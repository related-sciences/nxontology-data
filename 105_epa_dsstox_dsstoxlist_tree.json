The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA\"s physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling. All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA\"s full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA\"s ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA\"s ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA\"s physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health\"s National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences).

EPA researchers developed the EDSP Universe of Chemicals Dashboard to provide access to chemical data on over 1,800 chemicals of interest. The purpose of the EDSP Dashboard is to help the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program evaluate chemicals for endocrine-related activity.

Hence, an important and unusual characteristic of this toxicity database is that the 617 tested industrial organic chemicals were expressly chosen to serve as a useful training set for development of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). A second valuable aspect of this database, from a QSAR modeling perspective, is the inclusion of general mode-of-action (MOA) classifications of acute toxicity response for individual chemicals derived from study results. These MOA assignments are biologically based classifications, allowing definition of chemical similarity based upon biological activity instead of organic chemistry functional class as most commonly employed in QSAR study. MOA classifications should strengthen the scientific basis for construction of individual QSARs. However, it is cautioned that the broad MOA categorizations should not be construed to represent a single molecular mechanism; for example, CNS seizure agents and respiratory inhibitors are known to act through a variety of receptors. The DSSTox EPAFHM database includes information pertaining to organic chemical class assignments (ChemClass_FHM), acute toxicity in fathead minnow (LC50_mg), dose-response assessments (LC50_Ratio, ExcessToxicityIndex), behavioral assessments (FishBehaviorTest), joint toxicity MOA evaluations of mixtures (MOA_MixtureTest), and additional MOA evaluation of fish acute toxicity syndrome (FishAcuteToxSyndrome) in rainbow trout. All of these indicators, to the extent available, were considered in the determination of MOA and, additionally, were used to determine a level of confidence in the MOA assignment for each chemical (MOA_Confidence).",

EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks. NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but, rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk. This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest. Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter (PM). Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.",

This list is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Before Safer Choice decides to include a chemical on the SCIL, a third-party profiler (i.e., NSF, International or ToxServices) gathers hazard information from a broad set of resources, including the identification and evaluation of all available toxicological and environmental fate data. The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA\"s New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions. The list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL. Chemicals may be removed from the list or have their status changed based on new data or innovations that raise the safer-chemistry bar.

Originally released in March 2012, EPA\"s TSCA Work Plan helps focus and direct the activities of its Existing Chemicals Program. The Work Plan was updated in October 2014. The changes to the TSCA Work Plan reflect updated data submitted to EPA by chemical companies on chemical releases and potential exposures. After gathering input from stakeholders, EPA developed criteria used for identifying chemicals for further assessment. The criteria focused on chemicals that meet one or more of the following factors: Potentially of concern to children#??s health (for example, because of reproductive or developmental effects) Neurotoxic effects Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT) Probable or known carcinogens Used in children#??s products Detected in biomonitoring programs Using this process, EPA in 2012 identified chemicals in the TSCA Work Plan as candidates for assessment over the next several years, as they all scored high in this screening process based on their combined hazard, exposure, and persistence and bioaccumulation characteristics. In 2014, using new information submitted to the Agency, EPA updated the TSCA Work Plan.",

Dioxins have different toxicity depending on the number and position of the chlorine atoms. Because dioxins refer to such a broad class of compounds that vary widely in toxicity, the concept of toxic equivalency factor (TEF) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. Toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) exist for seven congeners of dioxins, ten furans and twelve PCBs as identified in a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/93/2/223/1707690\">World Health Organization Report</a>. The reference congener is the most toxic dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) which per definition has a TEF of one. This compound is extremely stable and consequently tends to accumulate in the food chain having a half-life of 7 to 9 years in humans.

For all available lists on the dashboard view <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/?search=pfas\">these search results</a>.<br/> Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) represent a growing, increasingly diverse inventory of chemicals of interest to the general public, scientific researchers, and regulatory agencies world-wide. Accompanying data-gathering, testing, and environmental monitoring exercises, in turn, have led to the publication and sharing of various lists of PFAS chemicals, some exceeding several thousand substances. A major effort was undertaken by EPA researchers within the National Center for Computational Toxicology to curate and structure-annotate several public lists in DSSTox. The below list of registered PFAS lists, from within and outside EPA, encompass PFAS of potential interest based on environmental occurrence (through literature reports and analytical detection) and manufacturing process data, as well as lists of PFAS chemicals procured for testing within EPA research programs. The consolidated list contains a number of PFAS CAS-name substances, with a subset represented with defined chemical structures. There is no precisely clear definition of what constitutes a PFAS substance given the inclusion of partially fluorinated substances, polymers, and ill-defined reaction products on these various lists. Hence, PFASMASTER serves as a consolidated list of substances spanning and bounded by the below lists, defining a practical boundary of PFAS chemical space (within DSSTox) of current interest to researchers and regulators worldwide.

This list is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Before Safer Choice decides to include a chemical on the SCIL, a third-party profiler (i.e., NSF, International or ToxServices) gathers hazard information from a broad set of resources, including the identification and evaluation of all available toxicological and environmental fate data. The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA\"s New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions. The list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL. Chemicals may be removed from the list or have their status changed based on new data or innovations that raise the safer-chemistry bar.

During wastewater treatment the liquids are separated from the solids. Those solids are then treated physically and chemically to produce a semisolid, nutrient-rich product known as biosolids. The terms #??biosolids#?? and #??sewage sludge#?? are often used interchangeably. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-08/documents/federal-water-pollution-control-act-508full.pdf\">Section 405(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA)</a> requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to (1) develop a regulation to establish pollutant limits and management practices to protect human health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of pollutants that might be present in sewage sludge; and (2) review sewage sludge regulations every two years to identify any additional pollutants that may occur in biosolids and to set regulations for pollutants identified in biosolids if sufficient scientific evidence shows they may harm human health or the environment. The regulation <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biosolids-laws-and-regulations#standards\">40 CFR Part 503, Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge</a> , was published on February 19, 1993 (58 FR 9248). Part 503 established pollutants limits for ten metals. Since 1993, EPA has conducted eight <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biennial-reviews-sewage-sludge-standards\">biennial reviews</a> and three <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/sewage-sludge-surveys\">national sewage sludge surveys</a> to review additional pollutants found in biosolids and assess possible exposure from those chemicals. To date, 726 chemicals have been found in biosolids. You can learn more about the curation of the list of chemical pollutants here: FUTURE LINK TO ARTICLE. Concentration data is also available for 484 chemical pollutants detected in the three national sewage sludge surveys here: FUTURE LINK TO DOWNLOAD CONCENTRATION DATA. To view all the microbial pollutants found in biosolids see Table B-1, Chemical and Microbial Pollutants Identified in Biosolids in <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biennial-report-no-8-reporting-period-2018-2019\">Biennial Review No. 8</a>.

For all available lists on the dashboard view <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/?search=pfas\">these search results</a>.<br/> Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) represent a growing, increasingly diverse inventory of chemicals of interest to the general public, scientific researchers, and regulatory agencies world-wide. Accompanying data-gathering, testing, and environmental monitoring exercises, in turn, have led to the publication and sharing of various lists of PFAS chemicals, some exceeding several thousand substances. A major effort was undertaken by EPA researchers within the National Center for Computational Toxicology to curate and structure-annotate several public lists in DSSTox. The below list of registered PFAS lists, from within and outside EPA, encompass PFAS of potential interest based on environmental occurrence (through literature reports and analytical detection) and manufacturing process data, as well as lists of PFAS chemicals procured for testing within EPA research programs. The consolidated list contains a number of PFAS CAS-name substances, with a subset represented with defined chemical structures. There is no precisely clear definition of what constitutes a PFAS substance given the inclusion of partially fluorinated substances, polymers, and ill-defined reaction products on these various lists. Hence, PFASMASTER serves as a consolidated list of substances spanning and bounded by the below lists, defining a practical boundary of PFAS chemical space (within DSSTox) of current interest to researchers and regulators worldwide.

Water quality standards may contain additional provisions outside the scope of the Clean Water Act, its implementing federal regulations, or EPA\"s authority. In some cases, these additional provisions have been included as supplementary information. EPA is posting the water quality standards as a convenience to users and has made a reasonable effort to assure their accuracy. Additionally, EPA has made a reasonable effort to identify parts of the standards that are approved, disapproved, or are otherwise not in effect for Clean Water Act purposes.",

The aim of this list and collaborative curation effort is to streamline how compound databases and spectral libraries deal with structures and spectra with different degrees of structural uncertainty, including partially or fully undefined structures, tentatively identified (Level Scheme: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es5002105) transformation products and isomer mixes through to spectra commonly observed in samples. Enabling automated and open exchange (DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.7b01908) of this information will greatly help streamline non-target mass spectrometry interpretation efforts. This MassBank.EU collection consists of the databases Eawag Additional (EawagAddn), UFZ Additional (UFZAddn) and Literature Spectra (LitSpecs). This list is undergoing continuous curation/extension. The reference standard spectra associated with MassBank are available on all three MassBank servers: MassBank.EU (www.massbank.eu), MassBank.JP (www.massbank.jp) and MassBank of North America (http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/) as well as the Open Data collection and will be part of a separate curated list.",

The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA\"s physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling. All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA\"s full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA\"s ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA\"s ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA\"s physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health\"s National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences).

The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA\"s physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling. All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA\"s full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA\"s ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA\"s ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated.

The changes to the TSCA Work Plan reflect updated data submitted to EPA by chemical companies on chemical releases and potential exposures. After gathering input from stakeholders, EPA developed criteria used for identifying chemicals for further assessment. The criteria focused on chemicals that meet one or more of the following factors: Potentially of concern to children#??s health (for example, because of reproductive or developmental effects) Neurotoxic effects Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT) Probable or known carcinogens Used in children#??s products Detected in biomonitoring programs Using this process, EPA in 2012 identified chemicals in the TSCA Work Plan as candidates for assessment over the next several years, as they all scored high in this screening process based on their combined hazard, exposure, and persistence and bioaccumulation characteristics.

This is the first update to the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments, which EPA presented in early 2012. As newer data from TRI and CDR become available, EPA will update the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments. The Agency uses this Work Plan to focus the activities of the Existing Chemicals Program in the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) so that existing chemicals having the highest potential for exposure and hazard are assessed, and, if warranted, are subject to risk reduction actions.

The content of the list will change over time as both the non-confidential active TSCA inventory is updated and more substances are curated.<br><br>Long_Description: Section 8 (b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to compile, keep current and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed, including imports, in the United States for uses under TSCA. Information about what types of substances are on the TSCA inventory can be found here. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, requires EPA to designate chemical substances on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory as either #??active#?? or #??inactive#?? in U.S. commerce. To accomplish this, EPA finalized a rule requiring industry reporting of chemicals manufactured (including imported) or processed in the U.S.. This reporting is used to identify which chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory are active in U.S. commerce and help inform the prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation. The list contained in the dashboard includes the active TSCA inventory based on notifications through Feb. 7th 2018 and substances reported from Feb 8, 2018 #?? March 30, 2018 that have been unambiguously mapped to DSSTox using CASRN and chemical names. The curation of the non-confidential portion of active TSCA inventory is an ongoing process involving trained chemists to validate the correctness of DSSTox structural and identifier data. The content of the list will change over time as the non-confidential active TSCA inventory is updated and more substances are curated. (Updated March 20th 2020)",

This list is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Before Safer Choice decides to include a chemical on the SCIL, a third-party profiler (i.e., NSF, International or ToxServices) gathers hazard information from a broad set of resources, including the identification and evaluation of all available toxicological and environmental fate data. The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA\"s New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions. The list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL. Chemicals may be removed from the list or have their status changed based on new data or innovations that raise the safer-chemistry bar. Safer Choice will ensure that no confidential or trade secret information appears in this list.",

EPA researchers developed the EDSP Universe of Chemicals Dashboard to provide access to chemical data on over 1,800 chemicals of interest. The purpose of the EDSP Dashboard is to help the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program evaluate chemicals for endocrine-related activity. The data for this version of the Dashboard comes from various sources:<br/><br/> #?# Rapid, automated (or in vitro high-throughput) chemical screening data generated by the EPA#??s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) project and the federal Toxicity Testing in the 21st century (Tox21) collaboration.<br/> #?# Chemical exposure data and prediction models (ExpoCastDB).<br/> #?# High quality chemical structures and annotations (DSSTox).<br/> #?# Physchem Properties Database (PhysChemDB).<br/><br/> The Dashboard displays bioassay information, bioactivity concentrations, estrogen and androgen receptor (ER and AR) model results, predicted physicochemical properties, and more. Current chemical and bioassay data can be accessed at <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard\">https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data</a> .

There are many factors that determine whether a chemical will cause a specific adverse health outcome. Careful review is required to determine the use of the data in a particular decision context.<br/> #?# Interpretation of ToxCast data is expected to change over time as both the science and analytical methods improve.<br/> #?# Additional substances that are not part of the EDSP#??s statutory authority are included since they are relevant to EPA#??s ongoing work on the validation of the endocrine and androgen bioactivity models.<br/><br/> EPA will continuously update chemicals on the EDSP Dashboard to include as much relevant information on chemicals in the EDSP <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/endocrine-disruptor-screening-program-edsp-universe-chemicals\">Universe of Chemicals</a> as possible. Some #??EDSP Universe of Chemicals#?? do not have bioactivity information in the EDSP Dashboard because of the incompatibility of some chemicals to be tested in ToxCast (e.g., chemical too volatile, chemical not soluble in DMSO, etc.). <br/><br/> The <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/edspuoc\">list of the EDSP Universe of Chemicals</a> contains approximately 10,000 chemicals, as defined under FFDCA and SDWA 1996 amendments.

Hence, an important and unusual characteristic of this toxicity database is that the 617 tested industrial organic chemicals were expressly chosen to serve as a useful training set for development of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). A second valuable aspect of this database, from a QSAR modeling perspective, is the inclusion of general mode-of-action (MOA) classifications of acute toxicity response for individual chemicals derived from study results. These MOA assignments are biologically based classifications, allowing definition of chemical similarity based upon biological activity instead of organic chemistry functional class as most commonly employed in QSAR study. MOA classifications should strengthen the scientific basis for construction of individual QSARs. However, it is cautioned that the broad MOA categorizations should not be construed to represent a single molecular mechanism; for example, CNS seizure agents and respiratory inhibitors are known to act through a variety of receptors. The DSSTox EPAFHM database includes information pertaining to organic chemical class assignments (ChemClass_FHM), acute toxicity in fathead minnow (LC50_mg), dose-response assessments (LC50_Ratio, ExcessToxicityIndex), behavioral assessments (FishBehaviorTest), joint toxicity MOA evaluations of mixtures (MOA_MixtureTest), and additional MOA evaluation of fish acute toxicity syndrome (FishAcuteToxSyndrome) in rainbow trout. All of these indicators, to the extent available, were considered in the determination of MOA and, additionally, were used to determine a level of confidence in the MOA assignment for each chemical (MOA_Confidence).",

CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure#??activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.

EPA, NTP and NCATS partners contributed approximately equal size inventories to the library, whereas FDA contributed a small set of drugs. EPA#??s contribution to the original TOX21SL fully covered its ToxCast inventory, so retains significant overlap with the current ToxCast HTS inventory (<a href=https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/toxcast#??target=#??_blank#??>TOXCAST</a>). The NTP contribution was drawn from the NTP bioassay and research testing programs of chemicals of interest to environmental toxicology, and the NCATS contribution consisted primarily of marketed drugs. Tox21 compounds were selected based on a wide range of criteria, including, but not limited to: environmental hazard or exposure concern based on production volume (industrial chemicals) or occurrence data, availability of animal toxicity study data, food-additives, fragrances, toxicity reference chemicals, and drugs or known bioactive compounds. Chemicals in the original Tox21 program underwent screening at the intramural NCATS robotics testing facility. All HTS assay data generated in association with the Tox21 program are publicly available through PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), as are the analytical chemistry quality control (QC) summary records generated in association with the Tox21 testing program. Tox21 assay data are also included in EPA#??s ToxCast data downloads (<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data)</a>.<br/><br/>For current information on the Tox21 program, see <a href=\"https://tox21.gov/page/home\">https://tox21.gov/page/home</a><br/><br/> Update (Nov 20, 2018):<br/><br/>The following publication coauthored by Tox21 Federal Partner Leads lays out a strategic and operational plan for the Tox21 program from 2018 onward: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324)</a><br> The plan articulates areas of focused scientific investment, both in chemical and biological space, to which new Tox21 cross-partner projects will be directed. In keeping with the new strategic plan, the Tox21 testing library moving forward is being consolidated under EPA chemical management and includes the full, currently available EPA ToxCast chemical library as well as approx. 1300 newly added chemicals provided by the NTP that were in the original TOX21SL library. The full chemical library available to the Tox21 cross-partner projects as DMSO solutions currently exceeds 6400 chemicals, of which nearly 6000 were included in the original TOX21SL library.

CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure#??activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature.

The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA\"s physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling. All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA\"s full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA\"s ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA\"s ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA\"s ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA\"s physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health\"s National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences). A detailed description of EPA\"s chemical management system and the DSSTox curation associated with chemical registration and mapping of the CHEMINV file is provided in the published document available for download at: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-chemicals-data-management-and-quality-considerations-overview\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-chemicals-data-management-and-quality-considerations-overview</a> For more information on EPA#??s ToxCast program, see: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting</a> https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting",

Dioxins have different toxicity depending on the number and position of the chlorine atoms. Because dioxins refer to such a broad class of compounds that vary widely in toxicity, the concept of toxic equivalency factor (TEF) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. Toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) exist for seven congeners of dioxins, ten furans and twelve PCBs as identified in a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/93/2/223/1707690\">World Health Organization Report</a>. The reference congener is the most toxic dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) which per definition has a TEF of one. This compound is extremely stable and consequently tends to accumulate in the food chain having a half-life of 7 to 9 years in humans.

EPA researchers developed the EDSP Universe of Chemicals Dashboard to provide access to chemical data on over 1,800 chemicals of interest. The purpose of the EDSP Dashboard is to help the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program evaluate chemicals for endocrine-related activity. The data for this version of the Dashboard comes from various sources:<br/><br/> #?# Rapid, automated (or in vitro high-throughput) chemical screening data generated by the EPA#??s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) project and the federal Toxicity Testing in the 21st century (Tox21) collaboration.<br/> #?# Chemical exposure data and prediction models (ExpoCastDB).<br/> #?# High quality chemical structures and annotations (DSSTox).<br/> #?# Physchem Properties Database (PhysChemDB).<br/><br/> The Dashboard displays bioassay information, bioactivity concentrations, estrogen and androgen receptor (ER and AR) model results, predicted physicochemical properties, and more. Current chemical and bioassay data can be accessed at <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard\">https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data</a> .

There are many factors that determine whether a chemical will cause a specific adverse health outcome. Careful review is required to determine the use of the data in a particular decision context.<br/> #?# Interpretation of ToxCast data is expected to change over time as both the science and analytical methods improve.<br/> #?# Additional substances that are not part of the EDSP#??s statutory authority are included since they are relevant to EPA#??s ongoing work on the validation of the endocrine and androgen bioactivity models.<br/><br/> EPA will continuously update chemicals on the EDSP Dashboard to include as much relevant information on chemicals in the EDSP <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/endocrine-disruptor-screening-program-edsp-universe-chemicals\">Universe of Chemicals</a> as possible. Some #??EDSP Universe of Chemicals#?? do not have bioactivity information in the EDSP Dashboard because of the incompatibility of some chemicals to be tested in ToxCast (e.g., chemical too volatile, chemical not soluble in DMSO, etc.). <br/><br/> The <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/edspuoc\">list of the EDSP Universe of Chemicals</a> contains approximately 10,000 chemicals, as defined under FFDCA and SDWA 1996 amendments.

Hence, an important and unusual characteristic of this toxicity database is that the 617 tested industrial organic chemicals were expressly chosen to serve as a useful training set for development of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). A second valuable aspect of this database, from a QSAR modeling perspective, is the inclusion of general mode-of-action (MOA) classifications of acute toxicity response for individual chemicals derived from study results. These MOA assignments are biologically based classifications, allowing definition of chemical similarity based upon biological activity instead of organic chemistry functional class as most commonly employed in QSAR study. MOA classifications should strengthen the scientific basis for construction of individual QSARs. However, it is cautioned that the broad MOA categorizations should not be construed to represent a single molecular mechanism; for example, CNS seizure agents and respiratory inhibitors are known to act through a variety of receptors. The DSSTox EPAFHM database includes information pertaining to organic chemical class assignments (ChemClass_FHM), acute toxicity in fathead minnow (LC50_mg), dose-response assessments (LC50_Ratio, ExcessToxicityIndex), behavioral assessments (FishBehaviorTest), joint toxicity MOA evaluations of mixtures (MOA_MixtureTest), and additional MOA evaluation of fish acute toxicity syndrome (FishAcuteToxSyndrome) in rainbow trout. All of these indicators, to the extent available, were considered in the determination of MOA and, additionally, were used to determine a level of confidence in the MOA assignment for each chemical (MOA_Confidence).",

EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks. NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but, rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk. This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest. Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter (PM). Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.",

Historically, skin notations have been published in the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards. This practice will continue with the NIOSH skin notation assignments for each evaluated chemical being integrated as they become available. A support document called a Skin Notation Profile will be developed for each evaluated chemical. The Skin Notation Profile for a chemical will provide information supplemental to the skin notation, including a summary of all relevant data used to aid in determining the hazards associated with skin exposures .",

This way we can rapidly establish the occurrence of newly identified compounds of emerging concern across Europe and beyond.

For all available lists on the dashboard view <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/?search=pfas\">these search results</a>.<br/> Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) represent a growing, increasingly diverse inventory of chemicals of interest to the general public, scientific researchers, and regulatory agencies world-wide. Accompanying data-gathering, testing, and environmental monitoring exercises, in turn, have led to the publication and sharing of various lists of PFAS chemicals, some exceeding several thousand substances. A major effort was undertaken by EPA researchers within the National Center for Computational Toxicology to curate and structure-annotate several public lists in DSSTox. The below list of registered PFAS lists, from within and outside EPA, encompass PFAS of potential interest based on environmental occurrence (through literature reports and analytical detection) and manufacturing process data, as well as lists of PFAS chemicals procured for testing within EPA research programs. The consolidated list contains a number of PFAS CAS-name substances, with a subset represented with defined chemical structures. There is no precisely clear definition of what constitutes a PFAS substance given the inclusion of partially fluorinated substances, polymers, and ill-defined reaction products on these various lists. Hence, PFASMASTER serves as a consolidated list of substances spanning and bounded by the below lists, defining a practical boundary of PFAS chemical space (within DSSTox) of current interest to researchers and regulators worldwide.

This list is designed to help manufacturers find safer chemical alternatives that meet the criteria of the Safer Choice Program. Before Safer Choice decides to include a chemical on the SCIL, a third-party profiler (i.e., NSF, International or ToxServices) gathers hazard information from a broad set of resources, including the identification and evaluation of all available toxicological and environmental fate data. The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA\"s New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions. The list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL. Chemicals may be removed from the list or have their status changed based on new data or innovations that raise the safer-chemistry bar. Safer Choice will ensure that no confidential or trade secret information appears in this list.",

EPA, NTP and NCATS partners contributed approximately equal size inventories to the library, whereas FDA contributed a small set of drugs. EPA#??s contribution to the original TOX21SL fully covered its ToxCast inventory, so retains significant overlap with the current ToxCast HTS inventory (<a href=https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical-lists/toxcast#??target=#??_blank#??>TOXCAST</a>). The NTP contribution was drawn from the NTP bioassay and research testing programs of chemicals of interest to environmental toxicology, and the NCATS contribution consisted primarily of marketed drugs. Tox21 compounds were selected based on a wide range of criteria, including, but not limited to: environmental hazard or exposure concern based on production volume (industrial chemicals) or occurrence data, availability of animal toxicity study data, food-additives, fragrances, toxicity reference chemicals, and drugs or known bioactive compounds. Chemicals in the original Tox21 program underwent screening at the intramural NCATS robotics testing facility. All HTS assay data generated in association with the Tox21 program are publicly available through PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), as are the analytical chemistry quality control (QC) summary records generated in association with the Tox21 testing program. Tox21 assay data are also included in EPA#??s ToxCast data downloads (<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data)</a>.<br/><br/>For current information on the Tox21 program, see <a href=\"https://tox21.gov/page/home\">https://tox21.gov/page/home</a><br/><br/> Update (Nov 20, 2018):<br/><br/>The following publication coauthored by Tox21 Federal Partner Leads lays out a strategic and operational plan for the Tox21 program from 2018 onward: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324)</a><br> The plan articulates areas of focused scientific investment, both in chemical and biological space, to which new Tox21 cross-partner projects will be directed. In keeping with the new strategic plan, the Tox21 testing library moving forward is being consolidated under EPA chemical management and includes the full, currently available EPA ToxCast chemical library as well as approx. 1300 newly added chemicals provided by the NTP that were in the original TOX21SL library. The full chemical library available to the Tox21 cross-partner projects as DMSO solutions currently exceeds 6400 chemicals, of which nearly 6000 were included in the original TOX21SL library.

EPA\"s TSCA Work Plan helps focus and direct the activities of its Existing Chemicals Program. Originally released in March 2012, EPA\"s TSCA Work Plan helps focus and direct the activities of its Existing Chemicals Program. The Work Plan was updated in October 2014. The changes to the TSCA Work Plan reflect updated data submitted to EPA by chemical companies on chemical releases and potential exposures. After gathering input from stakeholders, EPA developed criteria used for identifying chemicals for further assessment. The criteria focused on chemicals that meet one or more of the following factors: Potentially of concern to children#??s health (for example, because of reproductive or developmental effects) Neurotoxic effects Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT) Probable or known carcinogens Used in children#??s products Detected in biomonitoring programs Using this process, EPA in 2012 identified chemicals in the TSCA Work Plan as candidates for assessment over the next several years, as they all scored high in this screening process based on their combined hazard, exposure, and persistence and bioaccumulation characteristics. In 2014, using new information submitted to the Agency, EPA updated the TSCA Work Plan.",

This is the first update to the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments, which EPA presented in early 2012. As newer data from TRI and CDR become available, EPA will update the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments. The Agency uses this Work Plan to focus the activities of the Existing Chemicals Program in the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) so that existing chemicals having the highest potential for exposure and hazard are assessed, and, if warranted, are subject to risk reduction actions.

The content of the list will change over time as both the non-confidential active TSCA inventory is updated and more substances are curated.<br><br>Long_Description: Section 8 (b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to compile, keep current and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed, including imports, in the United States for uses under TSCA. Information about what types of substances are on the TSCA inventory can be found here. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, requires EPA to designate chemical substances on the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory as either #??active#?? or #??inactive#?? in U.S. commerce. To accomplish this, EPA finalized a rule requiring industry reporting of chemicals manufactured (including imported) or processed in the U.S.. This reporting is used to identify which chemical substances on the TSCA Inventory are active in U.S. commerce and help inform the prioritization of chemicals for risk evaluation. The list contained in the dashboard includes the active TSCA inventory based on notifications through Feb. 7th 2018 and substances reported from Feb 8, 2018 #?? March 30, 2018 that have been unambiguously mapped to DSSTox using CASRN and chemical names. The curation of the non-confidential portion of active TSCA inventory is an ongoing process involving trained chemists to validate the correctness of DSSTox structural and identifier data. The content of the list will change over time as the non-confidential active TSCA inventory is updated and more substances are curated. (Updated March 20th 2020)",

During wastewater treatment the liquids are separated from the solids. Those solids are then treated physically and chemically to produce a semisolid, nutrient-rich product known as biosolids. The terms #??biosolids#?? and #??sewage sludge#?? are often used interchangeably. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-08/documents/federal-water-pollution-control-act-508full.pdf\">Section 405(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA)</a> requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to (1) develop a regulation to establish pollutant limits and management practices to protect human health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of pollutants that might be present in sewage sludge; and (2) review sewage sludge regulations every two years to identify any additional pollutants that may occur in biosolids and to set regulations for pollutants identified in biosolids if sufficient scientific evidence shows they may harm human health or the environment. The regulation <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biosolids-laws-and-regulations#standards\">40 CFR Part 503, Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge</a> , was published on February 19, 1993 (58 FR 9248). Part 503 established pollutants limits for ten metals. Since 1993, EPA has conducted eight <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/biennial-reviews-sewage-sludge-standards\">biennial reviews</a> and three <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/sewage-sludge-surveys\">national sewage sludge surveys</a> to review additional pollutants found in biosolids and assess possible exposure from those chemicals. To date, 726 chemicals have been found in biosolids. You can learn more about the curation of the list of chemical pollutants here: FUTURE LINK TO ARTICLE.
