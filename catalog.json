Specifically, for purposes of this guidance, pharmacologic class is defined on the basis of any one of the following three attributes of the drug: <br/>1. Mechanism of action (MOA) ? Pharmacologic action at the receptor, membrane, or tissue level. <br/>2. Physiologic effect (PE) ? Pharmacologic effect at the organ, system, or whole body level. <br/>3. Chemical structure (CS).  <br/>B. Established Pharmacologic Class - An established pharmacologic class is represented by a term or phrase that is scientifically valid and clinically meaningful according to the following definitions: <br/>1) A scientifically valid pharmacologic class is supported by documented and submitted empiric evidence showing that the drug?s pharmacologic class is known, not theoretical, and relevant and specific to the indication. <br/>2) A clinically meaningful pharmacologic class term or phrase enhances the ability of professionals to understand physiologic effects related to the indication or to anticipate undesirable effects that may be associated with the drug or pharmacologic class.",

The 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels are often used to identify pharmacological subgroups when that is considered more appropriate than therapeutic or chemical subgroups.  Substances classified in the same ATC 4th level cannot be considered pharmacotherapeutically equivalent since their mode of action, therapeutic effect, drug interactions and adverse drug reaction profile may differ.",
        "Medicinal products are classified according to the main therapeutic use of the main active ingredient, on the basic principle of only one ATC code for each route of administration (i.e. pharmaceutical forms with similar ingredients and strength will have the same ATC code).  Immediate and slow release tablets will normally have the same ATC code.  A medicinal product can be given more than one ATC code if it is available in two or more strengths or routes of administration with clearly different therapeutic uses.  Normally, different stereoisomeric forms will have separate ATC codes.  Prodrugs are usually assigned separate ATC codes if the dosages used are different and/or the nonproprietary name of the prodrug and the active drugs are different."
