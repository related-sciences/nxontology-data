The evaluation is usually based on the results of epidemiological studies showing development of cancer in exposed humans. Agents can also be classified in Group 1 on the basis of sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals supported by strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent exhibits one or more of the recognized key characteristics of human carcinogens.",

This category may also be used when there is inadequate evidence regarding carcinogenicity in humans but both sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals and strong mechanistic evidence in human cells or tissues.",
