In low concentrations, they have no physiologic effects. Normally oxygen can be measured in air at 18% by volume or at a pO2 of 135 torr. Many simple asphyxiants have little or no warning properties. For some of the agents, the major hazard is their flammable or explosive properties (hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, methane, propane, and propylene). [ACGIH] Simple asphyxiants include: H: Hydrogen, Helium; E: Ethane, Ethylene; N: Nitrogen, Neon; C: Carbon dioxide; A: Acetylene, Argon; M: Methane; and P: Propane, Propylene.

[AHLS, p. 38] Aliphatic hydrocarbon gases include methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H6), butane (C4H10), isobutane (C4H10), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). LPG is a mixture mainly of propane, n-butane, and isobutane. These alkanes can cause CNS depression, cardiac sensitization, and simply asphyxiation. \"Hypoxia, as well as the stress that may occur with high concentrations of these gases, can elevate epinephrine. Thus, the asphyxiant, CNS, and cardiac arrhythmia effects may act synergistically.\" At concentrations of 14% (140,000 ppm) and higher, alkanes reduce the concentration of oxygen from the normal of 21% to below the critical level of 18% needed for the heart and brain to function.

[Mullan] Chronic effects that have been reported after heavy exposure include bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and asthma. [LaDou, p. 366] The two types of pulmonary agents are central and peripheral. Central pulmonary agents, e.g., ammonia, are water soluble irritants that injure the upper airways. Peripheral pulmonary agents, e.g., phosgene, Nox, and PFIB, are slightly water soluble irritants that injure the alveolar-capillary membranes. Chlorine has both central and peripheral effects. Peripheral pulmonary agents cause pulmonary edema that is delayed up to 24 hours after exposure. The \"4-hour rule\" states that the victim has received a lethal dose if pulmonary edema develops within 4 hours. [USAMRICD, p. 19-35] Most of the agents of toxic pneumonitis can also cause chemical burns if vapor or liquid come in contact with the skin. Immediate decontamination with clothing removal and copious water irrigation should be considered for ammonia and other chemicals with significant skin and eye contact.

After a dose of 100-200 rads, nausea and vomiting are possible three or more hours after the incident, and mild bone marrow depression can be detected. After a dose of 200 rads and higher, patients develop nausea/vomiting, and medical evaluation and treatment are required. The dose of radiation can be estimated from the onset of vomiting post incident:##<br><br>More than 2 hours after = less than 200 rads;##<br><br>1-2 hours = 200-400 rads;<br><br>Less than 1 hour = 400-600 rads;<br><br>10-30 minutes = 600-800 rads;<br><br>Less than 10 minutes = greater than 800 rads;<br><br>The severity of the radiation sickness can also be predicted by the slope of the absolute lymphocyte count.

The fatal dose to 50% of patients within 60 days is 400 rads. FINDINGS: The three syndromes of radiation sickness after high-dose, whole-body external irradiation are: 1.) The cerebral syndrome--greater than 1000 rads causes death in a few hours or days; 2.) The GI syndrome--greater than 400 rads causes intractable vomiting and diarrhea with few survivors; and 3.) The hematopoietic syndrome--greater than 200 rads causes bone marrow damage and resulting infections at 2-4 weeks and bleeding at 3-6 weeks. Patients with the hematopoietic syndrome have a mild prodromal phase beginning after 6-12 hours and lasting 24-36 hours. Symptoms in the prodromal phase may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, erythema, fatigue, and leukocytosis. Next is the latent phase, an asymptomatic period lasting more than a week prior to the manifest phase when bone marrow production drops to a critical level. The manifest phase is followed by recovery or death. Patients often have radiation burns to the skin that are similar to thermal burns except for delayed onset. Swollen and tender salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) are often detected in the first several hours after exposure. TREATMENT: Irradiated victims are not radioactive. First stabilize life-threatening conditions. Universal precautions are protective for healthcare workers. If externally contaminated, admit to a controlled area and remove clothing.

The chronic phase has an asymptomatic period followed by a symptomatic period. About 1/2 to 2/3 of patients experience an acute HIV syndrome 1-6 weeks (usually about 3 weeks) after exposure. The illness usually lasts about 10-15 days. Common findings are fever, sweats, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, and headache. Less common symptoms are nausea/vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrush. About 6% of patients with acute HIV syndrome have neuropathy and encephalopathy. The rash resembles measles, roseola, or urticaria and may affect the palms and soles.<br><br><br><br>CHRONIC FINDINGS<br><br>Patients with chronic infection are monitored with laboratory tests: HIV RNA assay measures the viral load; CD4 count measures the risk for opportunistic infections. The average length of the asymptomatic period is about 10 years. AIDS is defined by a CD4 count of less than 200 and an immunocompromised state in which the patient is susceptible to many cancers and infections. Possible indicators of AIDS include generalized adenopathy, chronic diarrhea, generalized herpes simplex, chronic candidiasis, and unexplained weight loss, fever, or dementia.<br><br><br><br>AIDS-RELATED OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS, TUMORS, AND SYNDROMES:<br><br>Bacillary angiomatosis<br><br>Candida esophagitis<br><br>Cervical cancer, invasive<br><br>Coccidioidomycosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary<br><br>Cryptococcosis, extrapulmonary<br><br>Cryptosporidiosis, chronic intestinal<br><br>Cytomegalovirus disease (other than liver, spleen, or nodes)<br><br>Encephalopathy, HIV-related<br><br>Hairy leukoplakia, oral<br><br>Herpes simplex, chronic ulcers; or bronchitis, pneumonia, or esophagitis<br><br>Herpes zoster (shingles) with >2 episodes or >1 dermatome<br><br>Histoplasmosis, disseminated or extrapulmonary<br><br>HIV nephropathy<br><br>Isosporiasis, chronic intestinal<br><br>Kaposi sarcoma<br><br>Lymphoma, Burkitt's<br><br>Lymphoma, primary, of brain<br><br>Mycobacterium avium complex or M. kansasii, disseminated or extrapulmonary<br><br>Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia<br><br>Pneumonia, recurrent<br><br>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<br><br>Salmonella septicemia, recurrent<br><br>Toxoplasmosis of brain<br><br>Tuberculosis<br><br>Wasting syndrome due to HIV<br><br><br><br>EPIDEMIOLOGY: <br><br>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a sexually transmitted disease and a global epidemic that began in the closing two decades of the twentieth century. From 2000-2020, a projected 68 million people will die prematurely from this disease. Seventy percent of HIV-positive persons live in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 2.4 million Africans died of AIDS in 2002. Without medical care and antiretroviral medications, the survival time of AIDS patients in Africa is often less than one year. Infection is transmitted mainly by sexual contact or contact with contaminated blood or needles. In the USA about 50% of infections are transmitted by men who have sex with men. In other parts of the world, most infections are transmitted by needles used to inject mood-altering drugs (Eastern Europe and central Asia) or by heterosexual intercourse (Africa). In some parts of Africa, HIV prevalence rates exceed 90% in sex workers and 50% in STD clinic patients. Anal intercourse and the presence of concurrent ulcerative STDs facilitate HIV transmission. Children are infected from their HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, delivery, and breast feeding. The risk of occupational infection after exposure to infected blood from needle injuries is less than 0.5% for HIV compared to about 25% for hepatitis B. Worldwide, new HIV infections decreased from an estimated 3.2 million in 2001 to 2.1 million in 2013. Most HIV carriers are asymptomatic and unaware of the risk to their partners and children. [PPID, p. 1469-1673; CCDM, p. 287-94; ID, p. 163, 2363; Merck Manual, p. 1625-42; Guerrant, p. 541; Cohen, p. 994-9] \"The continuing rise in the population of people living with HIV infection reflects the combined effects of continued high rates of HIV infection and the beneficial impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) resulting in fewer deaths. . . . As of December 2008, approximately 4 million people in low-and middle-income countries were receiving ART--a 10-fold increase over a period of 5 years.\" [Cecil, p. 2170]<br><br><br><br>For updated text and symptoms of infectious diseases, see iddx.com.",

Human cases of anthrax have been linked with imported, goat-hide drums. See CDC website for vaccination recommendations and map of endemic areas. [CDC Travel] Following the 2001 anthrax attacks, there were 11 cases of nonfatal cutaneous anthrax and 11 cases of inhalational anthrax (5 fatal). [Harrison, p. 193] Reservoirs are mainly herbivores, domestic and wild. Carnivorous animals may become infected after eating infected meat. Biting flies and scavengers feeding on infected carcasses may transmit infection. [CCDM, p. 22-29] Spores are respirable particles; they can survive in the soil for decades. Spores do not form in infected hosts (in vivo), but they are produced in cultures (in vitro) and in infected dead animals in which carcasses have been opened. [PPID, p. 2393] Since 2009, 31 cases of \"injectional\" anthrax reported in Scotland; [Gorbach, p. 74] Vultures, feeding on infected carcasses, may spread the disease.

The case-fatality rate of untreated cutaneous anthrax is 5%-20%. [CCDM, p. 16-17] Cutaneous anthrax begins as a pruritic papule. The skin surrounding the developing ulcer and eschar is edematous. Satellite lesions may appear. Anthrax necrotic ulcers are usually painless compared to painful brown recluse spider bites. [PPID, p. 2394-5] One of the uncommon causes of nodular lymphangitis; [Am Fam Physician 2001;63:326-32] For a differential diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax, search using the finding, \"entry wound with lymph nodes.\" <br><br><br><br>INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX<br><br>Patients with inhalational anthrax had fever, sweating, nausea/vomiting, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, hypoxemia, and elevated hepatic transaminases. The median WBC count was in the high-normal range. Of the 10 patients with chest x-rays, 7 had infiltrates, 7 had mediastinal widening, and 8 had bloody pleural effusions. Blood cultures (taken before antibiotics started) were positive within 24 hours. Postmortem findings included hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis. Vaccination and antibiotics provide the optimum protection after exposure. [JAMA. 2002;287:2236-52] Case-fatality rate may exceed 85%. [CCDM] CSF findings in hemorrhagic meningoencephalitis include bloody spinal fluid with large gram-positive rods. [PPID, p. 2397] Presentation may be biphasic with 1-3 days of improvement after first phase. \"Widened mediastinum on chest x-ray (CXR) may be present; pleural effusions frequently present; infiltrates are rare.\" [5MCC-2015] The three stages are: 1. Early prodromal (nonspecific findings); 2. Intermediate progressive (mediastinal adenopathy & pleural effusions); and 3. Late fulminant (meningitis, ARDS & shock). Patients in the 2nd stage can still be cured with antibiotics and pleural drainage. 8 of 11 patients in the 2001 anthrax attack had pulmonary infiltrates or consolidation. [Cecil, p. 1838]<br><br><br><br>GASTROINTESTINAL ANTHRAX<br><br>Undercooked meat from infected animals can cause gastrointestinal anthrax. Case-fatality rate is about 40%. [CCDM, p. 17]  A white pseudomembrane may develop several days after the onset of oropharyngeal anthrax. Patients have fever, dysphagia, and painful swelling of the neck due to cervical adenopathy. Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs rarely--in less than 5% of cases. In the intestinal form, low grade fever is followed by abdominal pain and vomiting. Other possible findings are ascites, hematemesis, and bloody diarrhea. [PPID, p. 2397] Oropharyngeal anthrax presents with pharyngitis, painful lymphadenopathy, and dysphagia. [Cohen, p. 1259] \"Mesenteric adenopathy on CT scan is likely.\" [5MCC-2015]<br><br><br><br>INJECTION ANTHRAX<br><br>This form is associated with heroin use, and most patients have soft tissue infection accompanied by edema similar to necrotizing fasciitis, cellulitis, or abscess.

Human infections usually occur in childhood after direct contact with the feces of infected dogs or indirectly through contaminated flies, fomites, food, or water. \"Dogs become infected by eating animal viscera containing hydatid cysts and begin to pass eggs 5-7 weeks later. Most canine infections resolve spontaneously by 6 months;\" [CCDM, p. 180-1] Ultrasound prevalence surveys have shown population infection rates as high as 6.6%.

[ABX Guide]<br><br><br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Cysts are found in the liver, lung, or other organs. Bile obstruction may occur and cause jaundice. Rupture of a cyst, depending upon its location, may cause fever, urticaria, abdominal pain, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. [Merck Manual, p. 1362] E. granulosa forms cysts in the liver 50% to 70% of the time, in the lung 20% to 30% of the time, and in other organs 10% of the time. Cysts can reach a size of 5-10 cm within one year. Cyst rupture can cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Serology assays are available from the CDC to confirm past exposure when suspicious cysts are found by MRI, CT, or ultrasound. [PPID, p. 3233-4] Echinococcus cysts can cause secondary myelitis--pain at the spinal cord level aggravated by coughing with asymmetric paresthesias and weakness below the level of the lesion. [ID, p. 1360] Hematuria is a sign of renal cysts. [Guerrant, p. 828] Rupture into the biliary tree can cause jaundice, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. A growing cyst in the liver can cause pain, jaundice, nausea & vomiting, and eventually biliary cirrhosis. Rupture of a cyst can also cause anaphylactic shock or septic shock. [Cohen, p. 1184-5] Nodular skin lesions may occur. [Guerrant , p. 963]<br><br><br><br>RELATED INFECTIONS: <br><br>The two other major forms of echinococcosis are alveolar (E. multilocularis) and polycystic (E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus). Alveolar echinococcosis may mimic hepatic carcinoma or cirrhosis. The name \"alveolar\" refers to the lung-like appearance of the budding mass. In contrast with E. granulosus, there are no cyst walls. Cysts grow into tumor-like masses. Common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain, malaise, and weight loss. Both E. granulosa and E. multilocularis can form cysts in the eye. The disease is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere and is maintained by a fox-rodent cycle. Dogs and, less often, cats may become definitive hosts after eating infected rodents. Serological tests are sensitive and specific. Common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain and weight loss. Treatment and prevention are similar to that for E. granulosa. [Guerrant, p. 824-38, 1015] Humans are infected accidentally after ingestion of ova-contaminated soil. [Cecil, p. 2057] Other intermediate hosts are pigs, wild boars, dogs, and monkeys. [ABX Guide]<br><br><br><br>Polycystic echinococcosis is a disease of South and Central America caused by E. vogeli (over 100 cases reported) or E. oligarthus (only a few cases reported). Like the other echinococcus species, infections occur primarily in the liver, but also in the lungs and other tissues. E. vogeli is maintained in a cycle of infection between bush dogs and paca. Domestic dogs may become definitive hosts. E. oligarthus is the only species of Echinococcus in which wild cats are the definitive hosts.

Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilium. Ticks are the vectors for HME and HGA. Meningoencephalitis is present in about 20% of patients. The Japanese form of ehrlichiosis (Sennetsu fever) resembles mononucleosis with sore throat, increased lymphocytes, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Neoehrlichia mikurensis infection has recently been described in Europe and Asia among the immunocompromised. [CCDM, p. 183-4] <br><br>3.  The agents causing ehrlichiosis are related to the genus Rickettsia. HME complications include meningoencephalitis, shock, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure. In one series of cases, 26% of the patients with HME had a rash. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases are characteristic of HME and HGA infections. The case-fatality rate was 3% for HME and <0.5% for HGA. Complications for HGA include shock, seizures, pneumonitis, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. Serological surveys show that organisms similar to E. chaffeensis infect humans in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. [Guerrant, p. 339-43] <br><br>4.  Most HME infections are not diagnosed, but 8386 cases were reported to the CDC between 1987 and 2012. Hospitalization is required in about 49% of cases, and at least 9% of cases are life threatening. Leukopenia is usually in the range of 1300-4000 cells/microliter, and thrombocytopenia is usually in the range of 50,000-140,000 platelets/microliter. Between 1995 and 2012, 10,152 cases of HGA were reported to the CDC. Rash is present in less than 10% of cases, but most of these are thought to be due to concurrent infection with Lyme disease (erythema migrans). Morulae can be seen in neutrophils in about 20-80% of patients. [PPID, p. 2229-32] <br><br>5.

The typical skin lesion is purplish-red and indurated. There may be a hemorrhagic blister but suppuration is unusual. Systemic symptoms (fever, lymphangitis, and lymphadenopathy) are present in only about 10% of cases. Complications include bacteremia, endocarditis, and rarely, brain abscesses, myocarditis, pericarditis, renal failure, infectious arthritis, and osteomyelitis. [ID, p. 1638-40; CCDM, p. 583] Swine are the major reservoir. Most infections are occupational (fishermen, fish handlers, butchers, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, and homemakers).

Diffuse cutaneous disease is a rare form of erysipeloid. The skin lesions may resemble urticaria, and most patients have fever and arthralgias. Another rare form of the disease is bacteremia. More than 90 cases of bacteremia, usually associated with endocarditis, have been reported. Congestive heart failure, glomerulonephritis, meningitis, brain infarctions, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis are complications of Erysipelothrix endocarditis.

[PPID, p. 1448] Rare complications are pancreatitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, aplastic anemia, transverse myelitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Terminal symptoms of fulminant hepatitis include coma, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and renal failure. [Harrison ID, p. 969] The stage of HBV infection can be determined using serological test results. See Table 3-3. [CDC Travel, p. 190] Myocarditis, pericarditis, pleural effusion, aplastic anemia, and encephalitis have been reported. [Cohen, p. 411]<br><br><br><br>EPIDEMIOLOGY:<br><br>Chronic hepatitis B infection rates vary from highly endemic (>8% HBsAg prevalence) to intermediate (2% to 7%) to low. \"Where endemicity is low (HBsAg prevalence <2%), most infections occur in young adults, especially through sexual contact and injection drug use.\" Any parenteral or mucosal exposure can transmit infection from a patient's blood. Fecal-oral transmission has not been documented. Patients with chronic infection have increased risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. [CCDM, p. 258-9] \"Among U.S. patients for whom a risk factor can be ascertained, most hepatitis B virus infections are transmitted sexually.\" [Harrison ID, p. 310] The only vaccines that target sexually-transmitted diseases are hepatitis B and HPV. [Cecil, p. 1796] In high-prevalence areas, most infections are perinatal and the rate of progression to chronic infection is about 90% compared to low-prevalence areas where most infections occur in adolescents or adults (1% progression to chronic infection). [PPID, p. 1446] \"HCP and trainees in certain populations at high risk for chronic hepatitis B (e.g., those born in countries with high and intermediate endemicity) should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc/anti-HBs to determine infection status.\" [ACIP, 2011] \"Patients who remain HBV DNA- and/or HBeAg-positive 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms are likely to develop chronic infection.\" [Cecil, p. 969] Immunodeficiency increases risk for chronic infection. [CCDM, p. 257]<br><br><br><br>VACCINATION:<br><br>Post-vaccination testing is not recommended except for high-risk groups (infants of positive mothers, healthcare workers, dialysis patients, and sexual partners of HBV carriers). About 3-10% of vaccinated subjects are \"non-responders\"; they should be revaccinated. Up to two thirds of vaccinated subjects lose their anti-HBs antibodies after 10-15 years; if at risk, they should receive a booster. [Cecil, p. 969]<br><br><br><br>POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS:<br><br>Non-immunized workers exposed to blood from an HBsAg-positive source should receive HBIG, and the vaccine series should be started. [CCDM, p. 264] For unvaccinated workers exposed to HBV-infected blood from a needlestick or cut, the estimated risk is 6-30% depending upon the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status of the source patient. [www.nccc.ucsf.edu/hiv_clinical_resources/pep_guidelines] Consider postexposure prophylaxis \"after HCP experience any percutaneous, ocular, mucous-membrane or nonintact skin exposure to blood or body fluid in the workplace. . . . Vaccinated HCP with documented immunity (anti-HBs concentrations of > or =10 mIU/mL) require no postexposure prophylaxis, serologic testing, or additional vaccination.\" [ACIP, 2011] <br><br><br><br>HEPATITIS D: <br><br>Hepatitis D virus (HDV) requires the presence of hepatitis B (HBV) for transmission. The incubation period is about 2-8 weeks. HDV is found only in patients who are positive for HBsAg. Studies in Europe and the USA have shown that 1/4 to 1/2 of fulminant hepatitis cases are caused by concurrent infection with HBV and HDV. Diagnosis is made by detecting anti-HDV by EIA. Rising IgM indicates ongoing replication. The most sensitive test for HDV viremia is reverse transcription PCR. [CCDM, p. 268-70] Clinical courses are similar for hepatitis B and D, but hepatitis D is more severe in regard to end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis, and risk of hepatocellular cancer.

The five forms of the disease are asymptomatic, acute respiratory, acute disseminated, chronic disseminated, and chronic pulmonary. Most cases of histoplasmosis are detected as incidental radiographic findings such as enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules. A high-dose exposure can cause an acute respiratory disease within 2 weeks of exposure. Complications of acute infection include arthralgias, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, mediastinal adenitis, pericarditis, and uveitis.

The main two types of influenza are seasonal and zoonotic. The best way to prevent influenza is annual flu vaccination. Avian flu carried by wild birds, especially water fowl, does not commonly infect humans. From 1997 through March 2016, about 650 humans were infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The H5N1 strain causes 53% mortality in humans and is acquired from close contact with sick or dead poultry.

      "description": "Set of Hazardous Agents related to Occupational diseases of type Infection, Occupational and subtype Leptospirosis.<br>INITIAL SYMPTOMS:<br><br>The most common clinical presentations are: 1. Flu-like syndrome; 2. Weil's syndrome; 3. Meningitis; and 4. Pulmonary hemorrhage; [CCDM, p. 348]<br><br><br><br>FINDINGS <br><br>Cases range from mild, inapparent infections and flu-like illnesses to severe cases with hemorrhage, hemoptysis, meningitis, jaundice, myocarditis, and hepatorenal failure. Cases are often misdiagnosed as dengue, malaria, meningitis, encephalitis, or influenza. [CCDM, p.348-53] The disease is biphasic with the septicemic phase lasting 4-9 days, then a defervescence of fever and the immune phase when aseptic meningitis develops in about 80% of cases. Conjunctival suffusion (no purulent discharge) is often seen on day 3-4. Some patients have severe muscle aches in the septicemic phase. Infrequent findings are iridocyclitis, optic neuritis, and neuropathy. [Merck Manual, p. 1267-8; ID, p. 1466-8; PPID, p. 2714-20] 90% of patients have the mild anicteric disease, and 10% have the severe icteric disease (Weil's syndrome). Transient maculopapular and urticarial skin rashes may be seen. In the second phase of the illness, patients may have headache and stiff neck. Petechiae and purpura appear along with conjunctival, GI, and pulmonary hemorrhages. Hepatomegaly is present, especially in icteric cases. Other findings sometime seen are pericarditis, lung infiltrates, pulmonary edema, and ARDS. [Guerrant, p. 303-7] Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are uncommon. Weil's syndrome has a 5-10% mortality rate. [Merck Manual, p. 1267-8]<br><br><br><br>WEIL'S SYNDROME:<br><br>Weil's syndrome is a severe form of leptospirosis with jaundice, proteinuria, hematuria, azotemia, bleeding tendency, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Renal biopsy shows interstitial nephritis, but immune-complex glomerulonephritis may occur. Severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (SPHS) may occur. This syndrome includes ARDS and septic shock. Cardiovascular collapse with shock is another complication. Severe neurological complications (encephalitis, myelitis, and coma) are rare. [Merck Manual, p. 1267-8; ID, p. 1466-8; PPID, p. 2714-20]<br><br><br><br>LABORATORY:<br><br>CSF analysis shows lymphocytic pleocytosis (usually <500/uL), protein <100 mg/dL, and normal glucose. [Merck Manual, p. 1268; ID, p. 1466-8; PPID, p. 2714-20] The WBC count is usually normal with a left shift (increased immature forms). Hyperamylasemia is common in severe disease, but pancreatitis is rare. The pattern of very high bilirubin and moderate elevation of transaminases is opposite the pattern seen in viral hepatitis (+++ transaminases and + bilirubin). [Guerrant, p. 303-7] Unlike cases of viral hepatitis, patients with severe leptospirosis have elevated serum creatine phosphokinase. Unlike other infectious causes of acute renal failure, patients with severe leptospirosis have hypokalemia. [Cecil, p. 1938]<br><br><br><br>EPIDEMIOLOGY:  <br><br>Humans are exposed directly by contact with the urine or tissues of infected wild and domestic animals or indirectly through urine-contaminated water (lakes, streams, sewers, and swimming pools) or urine-contaminated soil or plants. An animal vaccine is available. Leptospirosis is rarely transmitted person-to-person. Natural hosts include: rats, swine, cattle, dogs, raccoons, badgers, feral rodents, deer, squirrels, foxes, skunks, and opossums. [CCDM] In nature, these spirochetes survive as a chronic renal infection of animals. [PPID, p. 2715] It is the most common zoonosis worldwide. Two cases were reported after flooding at the University of Hawaii. The spirochete can enter through broken skin or mucous membranes.

      "description": "Set of Hazardous Agents related to Occupational diseases of type Infection, Occupational and subtype Lyme disease.<br>INITIAL SYMPTOMS:<br><br>Erythema migrans (EM) is estimated to occur in 80% of infected patients within 30 days of exposure. \"EM is a red, expanding rash, with or without central clearing.\" EM is often accompanied by flu-like symptoms. [CDC Travel, p. 235]<br><br><br><br>FINDINGS: <br><br>A red macule or papule (erythema migrans) is the initial finding in 70-80% of patients. In the classic presentation, the macule or papule expands concentrically with central clearing (annular shape), reaching a diameter of at least 5 cm. Other symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, stiff neck, myalgia, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy. Lyme disease does not develop in experimental animals unless the tick has been attached for 36 hours or longer (May be shorter for Ixodes ricinus;). Weeks to months after onset of erythema migrans, about 5% of patients develop arthritis, 3% have neurological complications, and less than 1% develop cardiac manifestations. [CCDM, p. 363-4] Most patients do not recall a tick bite because the nymph stage of the deer tick is so small. Other stage 2 findings include hematuria, malar rash, urticaria, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, pharyngitis, cough, and splenomegaly. Other possible findings (occurred in a few cases) are orchitis, iritis, choroiditis, myelitis, and osteomyelitis. In children, optic nerve damage may lead to blindness. [PPID, p. 2728-30] Lyme meningitis is preceded by erythema migrans (by 2-10 weeks) in less than 1/2 of cases. Most prominent are symptoms of headache and stiff neck. Other symptoms are fever, fatigue, aches, and weight loss. [PPID, p. 1118] The three stages are: 1.) Early localized (erythema migrans); 2.) Early disseminated (flu-like symptoms that may last for weeks followed by meningitis, Bell's palsy, or heart block); and 3.) Late (arthritis occurring in about 60% of patients usually within several months of erythema migrans); Less common findings are nausea/vomiting, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly.  [Merck Manual, p. 1269] EM varies in appearance; it is vesicular-pustular in about 5% of cases, and it may be purpuric on the lower legs. Patients may have tender regional lymphadenopathy. About 20% of patients in the US have more than one EM at the time of diagnosis. Multiple EMs are thought to be caused by hematogenous dissemination of the spirochetes. About 60% of patients not treated with antibiotics will develop arthritis about 6 months after EM with a range of 4 days to 2 years. Tick-bite hypersensitivity reactions occur within 48 hours of the bite, are often pruritic, and do not last as long as EM. EM lasts about 4 weeks. Unlike EM, erythema multiforme often involves mucous membranes, palms, and soles. [Cecil, p. 1930-5]<br><br><br><br>EPIDEMIOLOGY: <br><br>The enzootic transmission cycle is maintained by ixodid ticks and wild rodents. [CCDM] A vaccine became available in 1999, but it was withdrawn by the only manufacturer in 2002. [PPID, p. 2735] Deer play an important role in feeding and transporting ticks, but they are not competent hosts for the spirochetes. [Cecil, p. 1930]<br><br><br><br>LABORATORY TESTING: <br><br>Testing not indicated for patients with subjective symptoms only, e.g., fatigue and muscle pain; High rate of false positives (up to 90%) for IgM Western blot when screening patients with symptoms >1 month; [ABX Guide] CDC criteria: IgM western blot must show at least 2 of 3 defined bands and IgG western blot must show at least 5 of 10 bands to be considered positive. [Harrison, p. 665] Clinical diagnosis (EM and travel to endemic area) is sufficient. Perform 2-tiered serological testing (ELISA/IFA and confirmatory Western blot) for cases of possible disseminated infection. Test with C6-based ELISA if Lyme infection acquired in Europe. [CDC Travel, p. 232]<br><br><br><br>RELATED INFECTIONS: <br><br>Several different strains of B. burgdorferi have been identified in Europe. Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) is a related infectious disease that has not yet been completely defined. It resembles Lyme disease with the typical erythema migrans type of rash. However, STARI follows the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) while Lyme disease follows the bite of the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificis). The spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes Lyme disease. Tests for Borrelia burgdorferi are negative in patients with STARI. A spirochete (Borrelia lonestari) has been isolated from a skin biopsy and infected ticks. Treatment is with doxycycline or amoxicillin, and there are no late manifestations.

Hemorrhagic cases have been reported among immunocompromised patients. The prognosis for full recovery is good even for severe cases, but convalescence with fatigue and vasomotor instability may be prolonged. [CCDM, p. 367] Occasionally, lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash accompany the initial fever. Orchitis, myocarditis, and arthritis are possible complications that usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. [PPID, p. 2035] After a flu-like illness in the first phase lasting 5 days to 3 weeks, patients improve. Some patients then relapse into fever, rash, headache, arthralgias, stiff neck, orchitis, parotitis, and hair loss. A minority of patients develop meningitis and usually recover without sequelae, but 1/3 of patients with encephalitis have persistent neurological symptoms. Encephalitis is a rare complication; it may be accompanied by paralysis, transverse myelitis, or acute Parkinson's syndrome. [Merck Manual, p. 1435-6] A large case series showed that 35% of patients were asymptomatic, 50% had a flu-like illness, and 15% had typical lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Sore throat and vomiting were common. Chest pain and pneumonitis occurred less frequently.

[CCDM]<br><br><br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Koplik spots (stomatitis) are white, raised, and 1-2 mm in diameter. They are located on the buccal mucosa near the lower molars, starting 2 days before the onset of the rash and fading after about 4 days. Lymphadenopathy (cervical, postauricular, and/or occipital) is common. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain occur occasionally in younger children. [ID, p. 1181-2] Measles can cause severe pharyngitis. [Cohen, p. 267] Measles does not cause sore throat. The rash covers the entire body, but the palms and soles may be spared. [Cecil, p. 2105-6] Desquamation follows the disappearance of the rash. [Merck Manual, p. 1459] Atypical measles has been described in patients who received inactivated measles vaccine and then were exposed to measles virus 2-4 years later. The rash was maculopapular, urticarial, or petechial; it was sometimes on the palms and soles and sometimes vesicular. Respiratory distress was common. Atypical measles has also been reported in patients who had received live measles vaccine. [ID, p. 1182]<br><br><br><br>COMPLICATIONS:<br><br>Pneumonia is the most common severe complication, and it is responsible for the majority of deaths. Complications strike most frequently children <5 years and adults >20 years. [Cecil, p. 2106] Giant-cell pneumonitis occurs in AIDS patients. Most complications are due to secondary bacterial infections, e.g., otitis media and pneumonia. [Harrison ID, p. 1013] Complications of measles caused by either the virus or bacterial superinfection include pneumonia, otitis media, diarrhea, and encephalitis. In malnourished children, measles may precipitate a hemorrhagic rash, acute kwashiorkor, and blindness. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis occurs several years after the infection in about 4-11 per 100,000 cases. Adults may have hepatitis, hypocalcemia, and elevated creatinine phosphokinase levels. [CCDM, p. 389-90] The incidence of acute encephalitis is 1 in 1000-2000 cases of measles. Pneumonia is common. [PPID, p. 1970] Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a complication months to years after the initial infection. Risk factors are not known. Symptoms include progressive mental impairment, seizures, coma, and death. [Cohen, p. 1522] Transient hepatitis may occur during the acute phase. Encephalitis may present with seizures. Features of atypical measles may include abdominal pain, pneumonia, hilar adenopathy, and a rash that is vesicular, urticarial or purpuric. Severe bleeding may accompany acute thrombocytopenic purpura. [Merck Manual, p. 1459] At risk for severe measles: patients with AIDS, immune suppression, cancer, or vitamin A deficiency; [ABX Guide] Case mortality rates range from <1% (developed countries), to 5-10% (sub-Saharan Africa), to 20-30% (refugee camps). [Harrison ID, p. 1013]<br><br><br><br>PREVENTION: <br><br>Health care personnel (HCP) are immune if they have received 2 doses of measles vaccine or have antibodies to measles virus. [Harrison ID, p. 1010] \"Persons infected with measles are infectious 4 days before rash onset through 4 days after rash onset. . . . When a person who is suspected of having measles visits a health-care facility, airborne infection-control precautions should be followed stringently. . . . If possible, only staff with presumptive evidence of immunity should enter the room of a person with suspect or confirmed measles. . . . Because of the possibility, albeit low (~1%), of measles vaccine failure in HCP exposed to infected patients, all HCP should observe airborne precautions in caring for patients with measles. . . . Case-patient contacts who do not have presumptive evidence of measles immunity should be vaccinated, offered intramuscular immune globulin of 0.25 mL/kg (40 mg IgG/kg), which is the standard dosage for nonimmunocompromised persons, or quarantined until 21 days after their exposure to the case-patient. . . . Available data suggest that live virus measles vaccine, if administered within 72 hours of measles exposure, will prevent, or modify disease.

The rash is distinctive in its early onset (within 2 hours of fever), distribution (appears on ankles, wrists, and armpits), and character (petechial with discrete lesions 1-2 mm in diameter on the trunk and lower extremities). The rash usually spares the palms and soles. It may appear as papules initially, but quickly progresses to petechiae and purpura. Ecchymoses are common at points of pressure from clothing such as underwear and stockings. Rubella-like and vesicular rashes have been described in some patients. Patients may have pharyngitis.

The fatality rate for variola major was about 30% in unvaccinated populations. Transmission was by inhalation of droplets or inoculation of skin or conjunctiva. Less than 3% of variola major cases followed a hemorrhagic, rapidly fatal course. [CCDM, p. 561-4] Patients are not contagious until the rash appears, and at that stage, most patients are bedridden. Therefore, most secondary cases would occur in households and hospitals. Laundry and waste from patients are potential sources of infection. Encephalitis, similar to that observed in cases of measles and varicella, may occur. Petechiae and bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes may occur in the 10% of smallpox cases that are termed \"malignant\" or \"hemorrhagic.\" Smallpox can be rapidly confirmed in the laboratory by electron microscopy of fluid from vesicles or pustules. \"Vaccination administered within 4 days of first exposure has been shown to offer some protection against acquiring infection and significant protection against a fatal outcome.\" [Henderson DA, et al. Smallpox as a biological weapon.JAMA.1999;281:1735-45.] Hemorrhagic shock is one of the causes of death.

Migration of larvae through the lungs can produce cough, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, hemoptysis, and eosinophilia. Then, patients have diarrhea and abdominal pain. Findings in chronic infection may include: asymptomatic (50%); intermittent eosinophilia (75%); recurrent rashes of the thighs, buttocks, and perineum; a serpiginous rash (larva currens) that migrates up to 10 cm/hour; and GI symptoms with epigastric pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool; and, in heavy infections, bowel obstruction. Respiratory symptoms are uncommon in chronic, uncomplicated infections. Complications of hyperinfection include intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary infection, meningitis, brain abscesses, and liver infection.

The clinical presentation may include gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, abdominal mass, bowel obstruction, and acute abdomen secondary to perforation. Rarely, TB patients develop eye infections (uveitis or oculoglandular conjunctivitis); skin infections (nodules or warty growths); or infections of the larynx, sinuses, salivary glands, and adrenal glands. Other complications of TB include pericarditis, epididymo-orchitis, female genital tract infections, arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Worldwide, TB is the most common cause of granulomatous hepatitis--jaundice may occur. Pott's disease involves two adjacent vertebral bodies with narrowing of the intervertebral disc.

Identification of acid fast bacilli is a less sensitive and specific method. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing of sputum is a rapid technique, more sensitive and specific than acid fast staining, but less sensitive than culture.

Worldwide, most exposures occur in the household, and only 1/2 of close contacts become infected. Healthcare workers are exposed to tubercle bacilli in airborne droplet nuclei while caring for patients with tuberculosis and while performing bronchoscopies or endotracheal intubations on these patients. Approximately 90%-95% of those newly infected with tuberculosis never develop clinical illness. These individuals have a latent infection that may persist for a lifetime. Silicosis and other debilitating diseases can impair the immune system and increase the risk for activation of latent tuberculosis. In some sub-Saharan areas of Africa, 10%-15% of adults are co-infected with HIV and TB. To become infected, one must breathe the air contaminated by a coughing, sneezing, or talking patient with active TB. The likelihood of infection increases as the exposure period extends longer than just a few minutes or a few hours, e.g., attending to a patient with active TB in a hospital, prison, or homeless shelter. TB is transmitted rarely by direct contact with infected tissues, e.g., a pathologist with a \"prosector's wart.\" The only reservoir for M. tuberculosis is other humans. Many animals are susceptible to infection, and rarely, the disease spreads through infected monkeys, cattle, badgers, swine, and other mammals.

[The vesicle looks like a teardrop on a red base or a \"dew drop on a rose petal.\"]. Unlike smallpox vesicles, they collapse when punctured. Complications of chickenpox include pneumonia, encephalitis, and bleeding. Herpes zoster occurs in patients previously infected with the chickenpox virus. The reactivation of the dormant varicella virus occurs in the dorsal root ganglion. Some patients develop permanent pain (postherpetic neuralgia) in the affected dermatome. [CCDM, p. 669-70] The lesions appear as successive crops over 2 -4 days so that all stages of development (papules, vesicles, pustules, and scabs) are visible. Lesions are usually about 5 mm in diameter, but may be as large as 13 mm. Varicella pneumonitis occurs in about 1 in 400 adult cases. [PPID, p. 1733-4] In varicella-zoster myelitis from shingles, patients may have weakness in the myotomes corresponding with the affected dermatomes. [PPID, p. 1155] Vesicles in the mouth can cause painful swallowing. Complications include cellulitis, transient arthritis, hepatitis, and transient encephalopathy (occurs in <1/1000 cases and resolves in <2 weeks), and Reye's syndrome (coma). [Merck Manual, p. 1415] Herpes zoster may cause conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and, rarely, cranial nerve palsies. Blindness is a complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

VEE has caused tens of thousands of cases in Central and South America, and caused about 200 deaths in Venezuela in 1962-1964. About 10,000 horses were killed by VEE in Texas in 1971. WNV caused the following cases/deaths in 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively: 4156/284, 9862/264, 2539/100. In 2004 in the USA, about 1/2 of the WNV cases were febrile illnesses and about 1/2 were meningitis/encephalitis. The introduction of the JE vaccine in the mid-1960s caused the elimination of most human cases from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Throughout Asia, the vaccine led to the reduction of cases from 160,000 in 1966 to 16,000 in 1996. Since 1970, JE cases have increased in Southeast Asia, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

CEE and Looping ill usually cause a mild illness. [CCDM, 19th Ed., p. 47-9] About one in three people infected with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) develop symptoms. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, myalgias, and sometimes fasciculations. After a remission of 2-8 days, a minority of patients have the secondary phase of TBE with resumption of high fever, headache, and vomiting. The course for children is usually benign aseptic meningitis. Adults, and especially the elderly, are more likely to suffer complications of meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis. Weakness may be temporary or permanent. Of hospitalized patients with Far Eastern encephalitis, up to 20% die, and up to 60% have residual neurological impairment.

About 20-30% of patients develop chronic disease after a long asymptomatic period. [CDC Travel, p. 333] The chagoma is accompanied by local lymph node involvement. Patients with heart involvement may experience dizziness, syncope, and sometimes seizures. Patients with megaesophagus have dysphagia, chest pain, cough, and severe weight loss. Reactivation of infection occurs in AIDS patients, and brain abscesses are a common manifestation. [PPID, p. 3111-2] Chronic aspiration pneumonitis is a complication.

Freshly excreted bug feces of the triatomine vectors contain trypanosomes that may infect humans through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, and skin abrasions. Successful programs based on application of residual insecticides have substantially reduced transmission in Uruguay, Chile, and parts of Brazil. [CCDM, p. 633-7] 10% to 20% of recipients may become infected after transfusion of a single unit of contaminated blood. [ID, p. 2330-3] Among tourists returning to the US from endemic countries, only one case has been reported. [PPID, p. 3113] An estimated 300,000 immigrants in the US are infected with T. cruzi. Only 6 cases of autochthonous transmission have been reported in the US (TX, LA, TN, and CA). Blood donors were first screened for T. cruzi in 2007. The rate of infection in donors is about 1 in 13,300. [PPID, p. 3111] Transmission may occur by ingesting contaminated food or water.

This previously unrecognized coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV) is transmitted to healthcare workers and household contacts. Approximately 10-20% of patients develop respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The case fatality proportion is 9.2%. Patients develop either: 1) none to a few mild symptoms; 2) moderate illness; or 3) severe disease. In severe cases, the chest x-ray may show atypical pneumonia, and blood analysis may show decreased lymphocytes and platelets. \"By late July 2003, no new cases were being reported, and WHO declared the global outbreak to be over.\" [CDC website] Civets and other wildlife were thought to be reservoirs of SARS. [CCDM, p. 541] The initial symptoms in SARS were fever, usually with headache and myalgia. Nonproductive cough followed several days later. Diarrhea occurred in 25% of patients, and rhinorrhea and sore throat usually did not occur. [PPID, p. 1934 Less common symptoms are sputum production, pharyngitis, rhinitis, vomiting, and diarrhea. Petechiae, orchitis, and seizures may occur. Typically, the fever pattern is biphasic. Usually absent on the chest x-ray are cavitations, hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions.

The cysts of Cyclospora and Isospora, unlike those of Cryptosporidium, are not infectious when passed in the feces. They require days to weeks in the environment to sporulate. Isospora is rarely found outside tropical and subtropical regions. Isospora, and possibly Dientamoeba fragilis, are the only protozoans known to cause eosinophilia. [Guerrant, p. 641-4, 940] Isospora belli was renamed Cystoisospora belli. Findings are fever, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea (no blood), and eosinophilia. Chronic infection in AIDS patients may resemble cryptosporidiosis. [Harrison ID, p. 1210] Sarcocystosis is a similar disease caused by Sarcocystis spp. Most infections are asymptomatic, but gastroenteritis can occur. Humans are infected after eating poorly cooked beef or pork. In addition to diarrhea and abdominal pain, humans can also develop intramuscular cysts, myalgias, and eosinophilia.

The three phases of disease are febrile, critical, and convalescent. Fever lasts 2-7 days and may be biphasic. In the first phase, patients may have severe pain in the head, eyes, joints, and extremities. Other early symptoms are rash, minor hemorrhagic manifestations (petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematuria) and erythema of the face and oropharynx. It is important to recognize the early warnings of shock and begin intensive care treatment. Warning signs of severe dengue in the late febrile phase include persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding difficulty breathing, shock, and rapidly dropping platelet count and hematocrit (thrombocytopenia and hemoconcentration). Findings in the critical phase include pleural effusions, ascites, hypoproteinemia, hematemesis, bloody stool, melena, and menorrhagia. Atypical findings include hepatitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and encephalitis. Bradycardia and diuresis occur during convalescence. [CDC Travel, p. 162-8] This illness begins with 3-7 days of fever and severe myalgias followed by a maculopapular rash.  The rash spares the palms and soles, but desquamation may involve the palms and soles. Hematuria is infrequent, and jaundice is rare. [Guerrant, p. 954] DHF/DSS typically occurs at the time of defervescence with the onset of lethargy, thrombocytopenia, and hemoconcentration, and in severe cases, shock, cyanosis, hepatomegaly, ascites, pleural effusions, and GI bleeding. [Harrison, p. 722, 726-7] During convalescence, some patients develop an erythematous rash that may later desquamate. [CCDM, p. 144-5] CNS adverse effects in <5% of cases: encephalopathy or seizures.

[Merck Manual, p. 1432] Monkeys may be reservoirs for dengue fever in Southeast Asia and West Africa. [CCDM, p. 166] There are 4 serotypes of the virus carried by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which also carries yellow fever virus. The illness lasts about 1 week, and a rash is often present at the time of defervescence. A small proportion of dengue fever patients (usually children under the age of 12) develop dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS).

One to three weeks later, the hepatocytes release merozoites into the blood. Malarial paroxysms are associated with the invasion and rupture of red blood cells by these merozoites. Paroxysms are marked by fever, chills, headache, and nausea followed by profuse sweating. Other findings that may occur in all forms of malaria are anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. For P. vivax and P. ovale, infected hepatocytes can rest in a latent stage for 2-3 years. [Merck Manual, p. 1381-90] In one series of 160 patients in a travel clinic, symptoms were as follows: fever (100%), headache (100%), weakness/fatigue (94%), night sweats (91%), arthralgias (59%), myalgias (56%), diarrhea (13%), and abdominal pain (8%). The classic paroxysm lasts several hours and includes chills followed by high fever, then profuse sweating, and finally extreme fatigue and sleep. [PPID, p. 3072, 3081] As a general rule, uncomplicated malaria does not cause lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, or pulmonary consolidation. [Cohen, p. 1164; PPID, p. 3081]<br><br><br><br>SEVERE FALCIPARUM INFECTIONS:<br><br>The WHO criteria for severe malaria are any one of the following: cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, prostration, hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, hypoglycemia, jaundice, renal insufficiency, hemoglobinuria, shock, cessation of eating and drinking, repeated vomiting, and hyperpyrexia. P. falciparum can cause pulmonary edema and ARDS by sequestering in the tiny veins and capillaries of the lungs. Therefore, dyspnea is a finding in severe malaria. The urine may have the dark color of hemoglobinuria (black water fever) rather than the red color of hematuria. [PPID, p. 3075, 3082] Patients with P. falciparum malaria usually present within 4-6 weeks of their return from an endemic area. The fever pattern in falciparum malaria is \"hectic.\" Cough and dyspnea are present in fewer than 20% of patients. Splenomegaly is present in about 25% of cases. Even less common are jaundice, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Urticarial rash is rare. The WBC count is usually normal or slightly low (high in 5% of cases). Kidney function tests are usually normal at the time of presentation in the clinic. [ID, p. 2295] Inadequately treated patients with falciparum malaria may develop severe malaria: acute encephalopathy and coma, convulsions, renal failure, jaundice, pulmonary edema, bleeding diathesis, and shock. The other three malarias do not usually cause life-threatening disease. [CCDM, p. 372] Symptoms of cerebral malaria include deviated eyes, salivation, irregular breathing, opisthotonus, seizures, and coma. Complications, more common in children, include paralysis, aphasia, cerebellar ataxia, and cortical blindness. [Cohen, Ch. 111] Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in malaria.

Severe myalgias and sometimes paresthesias and fasciculations herald the onset of the major illness. The paralysis is usually asymmetrical. Reflexes are hyperactive initially, then absent. Bulbar disease may include dysphagia, pharyngeal paralysis, and dyspnea. Polioencephalitis is uncommon, occurs mainly in infants, and is associated with seizures. Guillain-Barre syndrome should be suspected if sensory loss (very rare in polio). [PPID, p. 2074-5] Because polio is an infection of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, sensation is normal.

Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever) is flu-like illness that may occur 2-8 weeks after the first exposure (primary infection) in an endemic area, i.e., an illness of previously unexposed visitors. Findings in Katayama fever include urticaria, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever and sweats, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or nodules. Late in the illness, eggs appear in the stool. Intestinal infections can cause fatigue, diarrhea, and colicky abdominal pain, and may lead to anemia, strictures, and obstruction. Eggs deposited in the eye can cause choroiditis and optic neuritis. Repeated hematemesis from bleeding esophageal varices, as well as portal hypertension and splenomegaly are findings in chronic disease.

After skin contact with creosote, PICD may be observed immediately after exposure to light. Workers handling the dyes eosin, methylene blue or disperse blue 35 are also at risk for PICD.  [Marks, p. 201-3] \"Tar smarts\" is a form of photoirritant dermatitis caused by coal tar pitch derived from coal, not by asphalt derived from petroleum. Workers complain of burning of the skin starting about one hour after exposure to pitch and sunlight. Erythema and blistering may ensue. Preventive measures include wearing long-sleeve shirts, gloves, and sunscreens. [Kanerva, p. 1685] The most common causes of photoirritation reactions are tar, creosote, and psoralens (furocoumarins) in certain plants. [LaDou, p. 328]",

      "description": "Set of Hazardous Agents related to Occupational diseases of type Skin Disease and subtype Contact urticaria.<br>Contact urticaria is mediated by either allergic or nonallergic mechanisms. Allergic contact urticaria is mediated by IgE, and affected patients are usually atopic. Contact urticaria may be confused with allergic contact dermatitis when the erythematous wheals evolve into a vesicular dermatitis. However, the clinical history will reveal that the patient with contact urticaria developed itching at the time or soon after contact. [Rosenstock, p. 709] Contact urticaria is an effervescent swelling and erythema (a wheal) of the skin that peaks within minutes to hours after exposure and usually disappears within 24 hours. Contact urticaria is a localized reaction after skin contact with the causal substance. The reaction is either type I (allergic) or nonimmunologic (nonallergic).  Generalized urticaria may follow the initial localized urticaria at the exposure site. [Asthma in the Workplace, p. 418-22] Some patients with contact urticaria have both immediate and delayed reactions. Other patients develop life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. IgE mediated contact urticaria is caused by the hair, urine, and saliva of animals and by latex, biocides, and some fruits and vegetables. Protein contact urticaria is an unusual type of contact urticaria that has been described in sandwich makers and other food workers who develop immediate itching, stinging, and vesiculation within minutes of handling meat or fish. [Marks, p. 310-11] Occupational contact urticaria accounts for about 30% of occupational allergic skin diseases in Finland. The most common agents causing immunologic contact urticaria (ICU) are food proteins, animal proteins, and natural rubber latex. Occupations most frequently affected are farmers, nurses, dental assistants, veterinarians, animal attendants, bakers, food handlers, and hairdressers. \"Skin tests such as prick tests are positive, negative in controls, and determination of specific IGE is possible.\" Non-immunological contact urticaria (NICU) occurs without sensitization. Severe symptoms like anaphylaxis are not expected. Examples of chemicals causing NICU are benzoic acid and cinnamaldehyde. Protein contact dermatitis presents as eczema (chronic hand dermatitis) and is caused by type I hypersensitivity to protein or proteinaceous materials. [Kanerva, p. 217-26]  Most reported cases of occupational contact urticaria are immunologic. Some low-molecular-weight chemicals rarely cause occupational contact urticaria: anhydrides, epoxy resins, polyfunctional aziridines, nickel, and reactive dyes.

There was very little smell. The foul smelling mercaptans are not produced in sulfite mills (10 % of US mills), but they are in Kraft mills (60 % of US mills). This mill did not produce its own wood chips, but purchased them from a supplier. The purpose of chemical pulping is to digest the lignin in the wood fibers, a process called cooking. The alkali and lime used in chemical pulping are recovered by evaporation and causticizing. The papermaking starts with the bleaching of the pulp. Various additives are used depending on the type of paper being produced. The cooking process is enclosed, and operating the furnace under negative pressure prevents the escape of gas. Except for spills and accidents, the only workers at risk for significant chemical exposures in the modern mill appear to be the maintenance workers. The Kraft or sulfate process is an alkaline digestion of the lignin with production of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans. The sulfite process is an acid digestion with the production of SO2 and sulfuric acid.

The most commonly used welding processes are shielded metal arc (stick welding), metal inert gas (MIG welding), tungsten inert gas (TIG welding), oxy-fuel welding, and submerged welding. <br><br>#? In stick welding, the shielding gas evolves from the flux coating of the electrode; in MIG and TIG welding, the inert gas is provided directly. <br><br>#? The most commonly welded metals are mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. <br><br>#? Stick welding on stainless steel produces higher hexavalent chromium exposure than MIG or TIG welding. <br><br>#? Welders are at increased risk for the following acute conditions: pulmonary edema from welding in a confined space; photokeratitis of the eyes from UV exposure; and metal fume fever from welding copper or zinc coated metals. [Burgess, p. 168-9] <br><br>#? Welding fume comes mainly from the filler metal and flux (if used); the contribution of the parent metal is relatively minor. <br><br>#? Coatings on the surface of the parent metal may be significant inhalation hazards. [Hendrick, p. 470] <br><br>#? Stick welding is the preferred method in the construction industry; it is less sensitive to the wind than MIG or TIG welding. [PMID: 17963139] <br><br>#? Advantages of stick welding: welding in all positions; inexpensive; and can be performed by unskilled welders.

Compared with SMAW, the most commonly-used welding type, any of the GMAW processes examined in this study have a substantial advantage with respect to fume or Mn reduction.\" [PMID 26267301]<br><br>#? \"GMA welding is also called metal inert gas welding, metal active gas welding, and gas-shielded metal arc welding. It is the most common industrial welding process due to its versatility, speed, relatively low cost, and adaptability to robotic welding. .. . . . FCA welding, also known as self-shielded tubular cored arc welding uses the same equipment as for GMA welding. It is rapidly becoming a popular and prevalent welding process worldwide due to the fact it can be used in all welding positions, is a quick process, requires less pre- and post-cleaning of the base metal and weld, and requires less skill to achieve good-quality welds.\" [IARC Monographs - 118, p. 42]<br><br>#? \"GTA [Gas Tungsten Arc] welding, also known as tungsten inert gas welding, uses a tungsten electrode to produce the weld. Due to the high melting point of tungsten, the electrode does not melt during the welding process. Further, a shielding gas (Ar or He is used to protect the weld and a consumable filler metal is added to make the joint. . . . GTA welding is therefore considered a high-quality weld, requiring a higher level of skill to master. It is commonly employed in the aerospace and bicycle industries, in machinery production for the food industry, in maintenance and repair work, and for spot welding.\" [IARC Monographs - 118, p. 43]<br><br>#?
