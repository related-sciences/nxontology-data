      "description": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human genome. The term \"7TM receptor\" is commonly used interchangeably with \"GPCR\", although there are some receptors with seven transmembrane domains that do not signal through G proteins. GPCRs share a common architecture, each consisting of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). About 800 GPCRs have been identified in man, of which about half have sensory functions, mediating olfaction (~400), taste (33), light perception (10) and pheromone signalling (5). The remaining ~350 non-sensory GPCRs mediate signalling by ligands that range in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins; they are the targets for the majority of drugs in clinical usage , although only a minority of these receptors are exploited therapeutically. The first classification scheme to be proposed for GPCRs divided them, on the basic of sequence homology, into six classes. These classes and their prototype members were as follows: Class A (rhodopsin-like), Class B (secretin receptor family), Class C (metabotropic glutamate), Class D (fungal mating pheromone receptors), Class E (cyclic AMP receptors) and Class F (frizzled/smoothened). Of these, classes D and E are not found in vertebrates. An alternative classification scheme \"GRAFS\" divides vertebrate GPCRs into five classes, overlapping with the A-F nomenclature, viz: Glutamate family (class C), which includes metabotropic glutamate receptors, a calcium-sensing receptor and GABAB receptors, as well as three taste type 1 receptors and a family of pheromone receptors (V2 receptors) that are abundant in rodents but absent in man.Rhodopsin family (class A), which includes receptors for a wide variety of small molecules, neurotransmitters, peptides and hormones, together with olfactory receptors, visual pigments, taste type 2 receptors and five pheromone receptors (V1 receptors). Adhesion family GPCRs are phylogenetically related to class B receptors, from which they differ by possessing large extracellular N-termini that are autoproteolytically cleaved from their 7TM domains at a conserved \"GPCR proteolysis site\" (GPS) which lies within a much larger (~320 residue) \"GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing\" (GAIN) domain, an evolutionary ancient mofif also found in polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1)-like proteins, which has been suggested to be both required and sufficient for autoproteolysis.Frizzled family consists of 10 Frizzled proteins (FZD1-10) and Smoothened (SMO). The FZDs are activated by secreted lipoglycoproteins of the WNT family, whereas SMO is indirectly activated by the Hedgehog (HH) family of proteins acting on the transmembrane protein Patched (PTCH).Secretin family, encoded by 15 genes in humans. The ligands for receptors in this family are polypeptide hormones of 27-141 amino acid residues; nine of the mammalian receptors respond to ligands that are structurally related to one another (glucagon, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1, GLP-2), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)).

      "description": "The nomenclature of the Adrenoceptors has been agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Adrenoceptors . Adrenoceptors, α1 The three α1-adrenoceptor subtypes α1A, α1B and α1D are activated by the endogenous agonists (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline. -(-)phenylephrine, methoxamine and cirazoline are agonists and prazosin and doxazosin antagonists considered selective for α1- relative to α2-adrenoceptors. [3H]prazosin and HEAT (BE2254) (BE2254) are relatively selective radioligands. S(+)-niguldipine also has high affinity for L-type Ca2+ channels. Fluorescent derivatives of prazosin (Bodipy FLprazosin- QAPB) are used to examine cellular localisation of α1-adrenoceptors. α1-Adrenoceptor agonists are used as nasal decongestants; antagonists to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin and silodosin, with the last two compounds being α1A-adrenoceptor selective and claiming to relax bladder neck tone with less hypotension); and to a lesser extent hypertension (doxazosin, terazosin). The α1- and β2-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol is used to treat congestive heart failure, although the contribution of α1-adrenoceptor blockade to the therapeutic effect is unclear. Several anti-depressants and anti-psychotic drugs are α1-adrenoceptor antagonists contributing to side effects such as orthostatic hypotension. Adrenoceptors, α2The three α2-adrenoceptor subtypes α2A, α2B and α2C are activated by (-)-adrenaline and with lower potency by (-)-noradrenaline. brimonidine (UK14304) and talipexole are agonists and rauwolscine and yohimbine antagonists selective for α2- relative to α1-adrenoceptors. [3H]rauwolscine, [3H]brimonidine (UK14304) and [3H]RX821002 are relatively selective radioligands. There are species variations in the pharmacology of the α2A-adrenoceptor. Multiple mutations of α2-adrenoceptors have been described, some associated with alterations in function. Presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors regulate many functions in the nervous system. The α2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, guanabenz and brimonidine (UK14304) affect central baroreflex control (hypotension and bradycardia), induce hypnotic effects and analgesia, and modulate seizure activity and platelet aggregation. clonidine is an anti-hypertensive (relatively little used) and counteracts opioid withdrawal. dexmedetomidine (also xylazine) is increasingly used as a sedative and analgesic in human and veterinary medicine and has sympatholytic and anxiolytic properties. The α2-adrenoceptor antagonist mirtazapine is used as an anti-depressant. The α2B subtype appears to be involved in neurotransmission in the spinal cord and α2C in regulating catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells. Although subtype-selective antagonists have been developed, none are used clinically and they remain experimental tools. Adrenoceptors, β The three β-adrenoceptor subtypes β1, β2 and β3 are activated by the endogenous agonists (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline. Isoprenaline is selective for β-adrenoceptors relative to α1- and α2-adrenoceptors, while propranolol (pKi 8.2-9.2) and cyanopindolol (pKi 10.0-11.0) are relatively selective antagonists for β1- and β2- relative to β3-adrenoceptors. (-)-noradrenaline, xamoterol and (-)-Ro 363 show selectivity for β1- relative to β2-adrenoceptors. Pharmacological differences exist between human and mouse β3-adrenoceptors, and the 'rodent selective' agonists BRL 37344 and CL316243 have low efficacy at the human β3-adrenoceptor whereas CGP 12177 (low potency) and L 755507 activate human β3-adrenoceptors [88]. β3-Adrenoceptors are resistant to blockade by propranolol, but can be blocked by high concentrations of bupranolol. SR59230A has reasonably high affinity at β3-adrenoceptors, but does not discriminate between the three β- subtypes whereas L-748337 is more selective. [125I]-cyanopindolol, [125I]-hydroxy benzylpindolol and [3H]-alprenolol are high affinity radioligands that label β1- and β2- adrenoceptors and β3-adrenoceptors can be labelled with higher concentrations (nM) of [125I]-cyanopindolol together with β1- and β2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Fluorescent ligands such as BODIPY-TMR-CGP12177 can be used to track β-adrenoceptors at the cellular level [8]. Somewhat selective β1-adrenoceptor agonists (denopamine, dobutamine) are used short term to treat cardiogenic shock but, chronically, reduce survival. β1-Adrenoceptor-preferring antagonists are used to treat cardiac arrhythmias (atenolol, bisoprolol, esmolol) and cardiac failure (metoprolol, nebivolol) but also in combination with other treatments to treat hypertension (atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol and nebivolol). Cardiac failure is also treated with carvedilol that blocks β1- and β2-adrenoceptors, as well as α1-adrenoceptors. Short (salbutamol, terbutaline) and long (formoterol, salmeterol) acting β2-adrenoceptor-selective agonists are powerful bronchodilators used to treat respiratory disorders. Many first generation β-adrenoceptor antagonists block both β1- and β2-adrenoceptors and there are no β2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists used therapeutically. The β3-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron is used to control overactive bladder syndrome. There is evidence to suggest that β-adrenoceptor antagonists can reduce metastasis in certain types of cancer.",

The three Bn receptor subtypes couple primarily to the Gq/11 and G12/13 family of G proteins. Each of these receptors is widely distributed in the CNS and peripheral tissues. Activation of BB1 and BB2 receptors causes a wide range of physiological/pathophysiogical actions, including the stimulation of normal and neoplastic tissue growth, smooth-muscle contraction, respiration, gastrointestinal motility, feeding behavior, secretion and many central nervous system effects including regulation of circadian rhythm, body temperature control, sighing, behavioral disorders and mediation of pruritus. BB3 is an orphan receptor, although some propose it is constitutively active. BB3 receptor knockout studies show it has important roles in glucose and insulin regulation, metabolic homeostasis, feeding, regulation of body temperature, obesity, diabetes mellitus and growth of normal/neoplastic tissues. Bn receptors are one of the most frequently overexpressed receptors in cancers and are receiving increased attention for their roles in tumor growth, as well as for tumour imaging and for receptor-targeted cytotoxicity. Bn receptors are also receiving attention because they are one of the primary neurotransmitters for pruritus.",

Their function and pharmacology are altered in the presence of RAMPs (receptor activity-modifying proteins), which are single TM domain proteins of ca. 150 amino acids, identified as a family of three members; RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3. There are splice variants of the CTR; these in turn produce variants of AMY receptors , some of which can be potently activated by CGRP. The endogenous agonists are the peptides calcitonin, α-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-I), β-CGRP (formerly known as CGRP-II), amylin (occasionally called islet-amyloid polypeptide, diabetes-associated polypeptide), adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin. There are species differences in peptide sequences, particularly for the CTs. CTR-stimulating peptide (CRSP) is another member of the family with selectivity for the CTR but it is not expressed in humans. CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) by itself binds no known endogenous ligand, but in the presence of RAMPs it gives receptors for CGRP, adrenomedullin and adrenomedullin 2/intermedin. There are several approved drugs that target this receptor family, such as pramlintide, erenumab, and the \"gepant\" class of CGRP receptor antagonists. There are also species differences in agonist pharmacology; for example, CGRP displays potent activity at multiple rat and mouse receptors.

Additional hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic roles have been identified for many chemokines in the areas of embryonic development, immune cell proliferation, activation and death, viral infection, and as antibacterials, among others. Chemokine receptors can be divided by function into two main groups: G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, which mediate leukocyte trafficking, and \"Atypical chemokine receptors\", which may signal through non-G protein-coupled mechanisms and act as chemokine scavengers to downregulate inflammation or shape chemokine gradients.Chemokines in turn can be divided by structure into four subclasses by the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines. CC (also known as β-chemokines; n= 28), CXC (also known as α-chemokines; n= 17) and CX3C (n= 1) chemokines all have four conserved cysteines, with zero, one and three amino acids separating the first two cysteines respectively. C chemokines (n= 2) have only the second and fourth cysteines found in other chemokines. Chemokines can also be classified by function into homeostatic and inflammatory subgroups. Most chemokine receptors are able to bind multiple high-affinity chemokine ligands, but the ligands for a given receptor are almost always restricted to the same structural subclass. Most chemokines bind to more than one receptor subtype. Receptors for inflammatory chemokines are typically highly promiscuous with regard to ligand specificity, and may lack a selective endogenous ligand. G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are named acccording to the class of chemokines bound, whereas ACKR is the root acronym for atypical chemokine receptors. There can be substantial cross-species differences in the sequences of both chemokines and chemokine receptors, and in the pharmacology and biology of chemokine receptors. Endogenous and microbial non-chemokine ligands have also been identified for chemokine receptors. Many chemokine receptors function as HIV co-receptors, but CCR5 is the only one demonstrated to play an essential role in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis. The tables include both standard chemokine receptor names and aliases.",

      "description": "Receptors of the Class Frizzled (FZD, nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR subcommittee on the Class Frizzled GPCRs ), are GPCRs originally identified in Drosophila , which are highly conserved across species. While SMO shows structural resemblance to the 10 FZDs, it is functionally separated as it is involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SMO exerts its effects by activating heterotrimeric G proteins or stabilization of GLI by sequestering catalytic PKA subunits. While SMO itself is bound by sterols and oxysterols , FZDs are activated by WNTs, which are cysteine-rich lipoglycoproteins with fundamental functions in ontogeny and tissue homeostasis. FZD signalling was initially divided into two pathways, being either dependent on the accumulation of the transcription regulator β-catenin or being β-catenin-independent (often referred to as canonical vs. non-canonical WNT/FZD signalling, respectively). WNT stimulation of FZDs can, in cooperation with the low density lipoprotein receptors LRP5 (O75197) and LRP6 (O75581), lead to the inhibition of a constitutively active destruction complex, which results in the accumulation of β-catenin and subsequently its translocation to the nucleus. β-catenin, in turn, modifies gene transcription by interacting with TCF/LEF transcription factors. WNT/β-catenin-dependent signalling can also be activated by FZD subtype-specific WNT surrogates. β-catenin-independent FZD signalling is far more complex with regard to the diversity of the activated pathways. WNT/FZD signalling can lead to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins , the elevation of intracellular calcium , activation of cGMP-specific PDE6 and elevation of cAMP as well as RAC-1, JNK, Rho and Rho kinase signalling. Novel resonance energy transfer-based tools have allowed the study of the GPCR-like nature of FZDs in greater detail. Upon ligand stimulation, FZDs undergo conformational changes and signal via heterotrimeric G proteins. Furthermore, the phosphoprotein Dishevelled constitutes a key player in WNT/FZD signalling towards planar-cell-polarity-like pathways. Importantly, FZDs exist in at least two distinct conformational states that regulate pathway selection. As with other GPCRs, members of the Frizzled family are functionally dependent on the arrestin scaffolding protein for internalization , as well as for β-catenin-dependent and -independent signalling. The pattern of cell signalling is complicated by the presence of additional ligands, which can enhance or inhibit FZD signalling (secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRP), Wnt-inhibitory factor (WIF), sclerostin or Dickkopf (DKK)), as well as modulatory (co)-receptors with Ryk, ROR1, ROR2 and Kremen, which may also function as independent signalling proteins.",

      "description": "Functional GABAB receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on GABAB receptors ) are formed from the heterodimerization of two similar 7TM subunits termed GABAB1 and GABAB2. GABAB receptors are widespread in the CNS and regulate both pre- and postsynaptic activity. The GABAB1 subunit, when expressed alone, binds both antagonists and agonists, but the affinity of the latter is generally 10-100-fold less than for the native receptor. Co-expression of GABAB1 and GABAB2 subunits allows transport of GABAB1 to the cell surface and generates a functional receptor that can couple to signal transduction pathways such as high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (Cav2.1, Cav2.2), or inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3). The GABAB1 subunit harbours the GABA (orthosteric)-binding site within an extracellular domain (ECD) venus flytrap module (VTM), whereas the GABAB2 subunit mediates G protein-coupled signalling. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human full-length GABAB1-GABAB2 heterodimer have been solved in the inactive apo state, two intermediate agonist-bound forms and an active state in which the heterodimer is bound to an agonist and a positive allosteric modulator. The positive allosteric modulator binds to the transmembrane dimerization interface and stabilizes the active state. Recent evidence indicates that higher order assemblies of GABAB receptor comprising dimers of heterodimers occur in recombinant expression systems and in vivo and that such complexes exhibit negative functional cooperativity between heterodimers. Adding further complexity, KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization proteins) 8, 12, 12b and 16 associate as tetramers with the carboxy terminus of the GABAB2 subunit to impart altered signalling kinetics and agonist potency to the receptor complex and are reviewed by. The molecular complexity of GABAB receptors is further increased through association with trafficking and effector proteins and reviewed by. The predominant GABAB1a and GABAB1b isoforms, which are most prevalent in neonatal and adult brain tissue respectively, differ in their ECD sequences as a result of the use of alternative transcription initiation sites. GABAB1a-containing heterodimers localise to distal axons and mediate inhibition of glutamate release in the CA3-CA1 terminals, and GABA release onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas GABAB1b-containing receptors occur within dendritic spines and mediate slow postsynaptic inhibition. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and soluble APP (sAPP) bind to the N- terminal sushi domain of the GABAB1a isoform to regulate axonal trafficking of GABAB receptors and release of neurotransmitters.",

The human gene encoding the precursor peptide has 83% sequence homology to rat prepro-ghrelin, although the mature peptides from rat and human differ by only two amino acids. Alternative splicing results in the formation of a second peptide, [des-Gln14]ghrelin with equipotent biological activity. A unique post-translational modification (octanoylation of Ser3, catalysed by ghrelin Ο-acyltransferase (MBOAT4, Q96T53) occurs in both peptides, essential for full activity in binding to ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, and for the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Structure activity studies showed the first five N-terminal amino acids to be the minimum required for binding , and receptor mutagenesis has indicated overlap of the ghrelin binding site with those for small molecule agonists and allosteric modulators of ghrelin function. An endogenous antagonist and inverse agonist called Liver enriched antimicrobial peptide 2 (Leap2), expressed primarily in hepatocytes and in enterocytes of the proximal intestine inhibits ghrelin receptor-induced GH secretion and food intake. The secretion of Leap2 and ghrelin is inversely regulated under various metabolic conditions. In cell systems, the ghrelin receptor is constitutively active , but this is abolished by a naturally occurring mutation (A204E) that results in decreased cell surface receptor expression and is associated with familial short stature.",

Receptors for three forms of GnRH exist in some species but only GnRH I and GnRH II and their cognate receptors have been found in mammals. GnRH1 receptors are expressed by pituitary gonadotrophs, where they mediate the effects of GnRH on gonadotropin hormone synthesis and secretion that underpin central control of mammalian reproduction. GnRH analogues are used in assisted reproduction and to treat steroid hormone-dependent conditions. Notably, agonists cause desensitization of GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion and the consequent reduction in circulating sex steroids is exploited to treat hormone-dependent cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. GnRH1 receptors are selectively activated by GnRH I and all lack the COOH-terminal tails found in other GPCRs. GnRH2 receptors do have COOH-terminal tails and (where tested) are selective for GnRH II over GnRH I. GnRH2 receptors are expressed by some primates but not by humans. Phylogenetic classifications divide GnRH receptors into three or five groups and highlight examples of gene loss through evolution, with humans retaining only one ancient gene.

Five additional LPA receptors (LPA2,3,4,5,6) have since been identified and their gene nomenclature codified for human LPAR1, LPAR2, etc. (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, HGNC) and Lpar1, Lpar2, etc. for mice (Mouse Genome Informatics Database, MGI) to reflect species and receptor function of their corresponding proteins. The crystal structure of LPA1 and LPA6 are solved and indicate that LPA accesses the extracellular binding pocket, consistent with its proposed delivery via autotaxin. These studies have also implicated cross-talk with endocannabinoids via phosphorylated intermediates that can also activate these receptors. The binding affinities to LPA1 of unlabeled, natural LPA and anandamide phosphate (AEAp) were measured using backscattering interferometry (pKd = 9). Utilization of this method indicated affinities that were 77-fold lower than when measured using radioactivity-based protocols. Targeted deletion of LPA receptors has clarified signalling pathways and identified physiological and pathophysiological roles. Multiple groups have independently published validation of all six LPA receptors described in these tables, and further validation was achieved using a distinct read-out via a novel TGFα \"shedding* assay. LPA has been proposed to be a ligand for GPR35 , supported by a study revealing that LPA modulates macrophage function through GPR35. However chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 17 is reported to be a ligand for GPR35/CXCR8. Moreover, LPA has also been described as an agonist for the transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1. All of these proposed non-GPCR receptor identities require confirmation and are not currently recognized as bona fide LPA receptors.",

      "description": "Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors ) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The mGlu family is composed of eight members (named mGlu1 to mGlu8) which are divided in three groups based on similarities of agonist pharmacology, primary sequence and G protein coupling to effector: Group-I (mGlu1 and mGlu5), Group-II (mGlu2 and mGlu3) and Group-III (mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7 and mGlu8) (see Further reading).Structurally, mGlu are composed of three juxtaposed domains: a core G protein-activating seven-transmembrane domain (TM), common to all GPCRs, is linked via a rigid cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to the Venus Flytrap domain (VFTD), a large bi-lobed extracellular domain where glutamate binds. mGlu form constitutive dimers, cross-linked by a disulfide bridge. The structures of the VFTD of mGlu1, mGlu2, mGlu3, mGlu5 and mGlu7 have been solved. The structure of the 7 transmembrane (TM) domains of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 have been solved, and confirm a general helical organisation similar to that of other GPCRs, although the helices appear more compacted. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided structures of full-length mGlu receptor homodimers and heterodimers. Studies have revealed the possible formation of heterodimers between either group-I receptors, or within and between group-II and -III receptors. First characterised in transfected cells, co-localisation and specific pharmacological properties suggest the existence of such heterodimers in the brain. Beyond heteromerisation with other mGlu receptor subtypes, increasing evidence suggests mGlu receptors form heteromers and larger order complexes with class A GPCRs (reviewed in ).  The endogenous ligands of mGlu are L-glutamic acid, L-serine-O-phosphate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate and L-cysteine sulphinic acid. Group-I mGlu receptors may be activated by 3,5-DHPG and (S)-3HPG and antagonised by (S)-hexylhomoibotenic acid. Group-II mGlu receptors may be activated by LY389795 , LY379268 , eglumegad , DCG-IV and (2R,3R)-APDC , and antagonised by eGlu and LY307452. Group-III mGlu receptors may be activated by L-AP4 and (R,S)-4-PPG. An example of an antagonist selective for mGlu receptors is LY341495, which blocks mGlu2 and mGlu3 at low nanomolar concentrations, mGlu8 at high nanomolar concentrations, and mGlu4, mGlu5, and mGlu7 in the micromolar range. In addition to orthosteric ligands that directly interact with the glutamate recognition site, allosteric modulators that bind within the TM domain have been described. Negative allosteric modulators are listed separately. The positive allosteric modulators most often act as â€˜potentiatorsâ€™ of an orthosteric agonist response, without significantly activating the receptor in the absence of agonist.",

There are significant species differences in the structure of motilin and its receptor, and in the functions of motilin. In humans and large mammals such as dog, activation of these receptors by motilin released from endocrine cells in the duodenal mucosa during fasting, induces propulsive phase III movements. This activity is associated with promoting hunger in humans. In humans and other mammals drugs and other non-peptide compounds which activate the motilin receptor may generate a more long-lasting ability to increase cholinergic activity within the upper gut, to promote upper gastrointestinal motility; this activity is suggested to be responsible for the gastrointestinal prokinetic effects of certain macrolide antibacterials (often called motilides; e.g. erythromycin, azithromycin), although for many of these molecules the evidence is sparse. Relatively high doses may induce vomiting and in humans, nausea.",

Despite species differences in NmU structure, the C-terminal region (particularly the C-terminal pentapeptide) is highly conserved and contains biological activity.

NmS-33 is, as its name suggests, a 33 amino-acid product of a precursor protein derived from a single gene and contains an amidated C-terminal heptapeptide identical to NmU.

Many of the agonists exhibit differing degrees of selectivity dependent on the species examined. For example, the potency of PP is greater at the rat Y4 receptor than at the human receptor. In addition, many agonists lack selectivity for individual subtypes, but can exhibit comparable potency against pairs of NPY receptor subtypes, or have not been examined for activity at all subtypes.

Agonist proteinase-induced hydrolysis unmasks a tethered ligand (TL) at the exposed amino terminus, which acts intramolecularly at the binding site in the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signalling. TL sequences at human PAR1-4 are SFLLRN-NH2, SLIGKV-NH2, TFRGAP-NH2 and GYPGQV-NH2, respectively. With the exception of PAR3, synthetic peptides with these sequences (as carboxyl terminal amides) are able to act as agonists at their respective receptors. Several proteinases, including neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and chymotrypsin can have inhibitory effects at PAR1 and PAR2 such that they cleave the exodomain of the receptor without inducing activation of Gαq-coupled calcium signalling, thereby preventing activation by activating proteinases but not by agonist peptides. Neutrophil elastase (NE) cleavage of PAR1 and PAR2 can however activate MAP kinase signaling by exposing a TL that is different from the one revealed by trypsin. PAR2 activation by NE regulates inflammation and pain responses and triggers mucin secretion from airway epithelial cells.",

Several structural forms of U-II exist in fish and amphibians. The goby orthologue was used to identify U-II as the cognate ligand for the predicted receptor encoded by the rat gene gpr14. Human urotensin-II, an 11-amino-acid peptide , retains the cyclohexapeptide sequence of goby U-II that is thought to be important in ligand binding. This sequence is also conserved in the deduced amino-acid sequence of rat urotensin-II (14 amino-acids) and mouse urotensin-II (14 amino-acids), although the N-terminal is more divergent from the human sequence. A second endogenous ligand for the UT has been discovered in rat. This is the urotensin II-related peptide, an octapeptide that is derived from a different gene, but shares the C-terminal sequence (CFWKYCV) common to U-II from other species. Identical sequences to rat urotensin II-related peptide are predicted for the mature mouse and human peptides. UT exhibits relatively high sequence identity with somatostatin, opioid and galanin receptors.

Activation of taste receptors appears to involve gustducin- (GÎ±t3) and GÎ±14-mediated signalling, although the precise mechanisms remain obscure. Gene disruption studies suggest the involvement of PLCÎ²2 , TRPM5 and IP3 receptors in post-receptor signalling of taste receptors.

Their gene nomenclature has been codified as human S1PR1, S1PR2, etc. (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, HGNC) and S1pr1, S1pr2, etc. for mice (Mouse Genome Informatics Database, MGI) to reflect species and receptor function. All S1P receptors (S1PRs) have been knocked-out in mice constitutively and in some cases, conditionally.  S1PRs, particularly S1P1, are expressed throughout all mammalian organ systems. Ligand delivery occurs via two known carriers (or \"chaperones\"): albumin and HDL-bound apolipoprotein M (ApoM), the latter of which elicits biased agonist signaling by S1P1 in multiple cell types. The five S1PRs, two chaperones, and active cellular metabolism have complicated analyses of receptor ligand binding in native systems. Signaling pathways and physiological roles have been characterized through radioligand binding in heterologous expression systems, targeted deletion of the different S1PRs, and most recently, mouse models that report in vivo S1P1R activation. The structures of S1P1 , S1P2 , S1P3, and S1P5 are solved, and confirmed aspects of ligand binding, specificity, and receptor activation, determined previously through biochemical and genetic studies. fingolimod (FTY720), the first FDA-approved drug to target any of the lysophospholipid receptors, binds as a phosphorylated metabolite to four of the five S1PRs, and was the first oral therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). Second-generation S1PR modulators siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod that target S1P1 and S1P5 are also FDA approved for the treatment of various MS forms. In 2021, ozanimod became the first S1PR modulator to be FDA approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The mechanisms of action of fingolimod and other S1PR-modulating drugs now in development include binding S1PRs in multiple organ systems, e.g., immune and nervous systems, although the precise nature of their receptor interactions requires clarification.",

Endogenous agonists are hydrophobic entities which, when bound to the receptor promote conformational changes in the receptor to allow recruitment (or dissociation) of protein partners, generating a large multiprotein complex.Two major subclasses of nuclear receptors with identified endogenous agonists can be identified: steroid and non-steroid hormone receptors. Steroid hormone receptors function typically as dimeric entities and are thought to be resident outside the nucleus in the unliganded state in a complex with chaperone proteins, which are liberated upon agonist binding. Migration to the nucleus and interaction with other regulators of gene transcription, including RNA polymerase, acetyltransferases and deacetylases, allows gene transcription to be regulated. Non-steroid hormone receptors typically exhibit a greater distribution in the nucleus in the unliganded state and interact with other nuclear receptors to form heterodimers, as well as with other regulators of gene transcription, leading to changes in gene transcription upon agonist binding. Selectivity of gene regulation is brought about through interaction of nuclear receptors with particular consensus sequences of DNA, which are arranged typically as repeats or inverted palindromes to allow accumulation of multiple transcription factors in the promoter regions of genes.",

These receptors exist as dimers coupled with chaperone molecules (such as hsp90β and immunophilin FKBP52:FKBP4, Q02790), which are shed on binding the steroid hormone. Although rapid signalling phenomena are observed , the principal signalling cascade appears to involve binding of the activated receptors to nuclear hormone response elements of the genome, with a 15-nucleotide consensus sequence AGAACAnnnTGTTCT (i.e. an inverted palindrome) as homo- or heterodimers. They also affect transcription by protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Splice variants of each of these receptors can form functional or non-functional monomers that can dimerize to form functional or non-functional receptors. For example, alternative splicing of PR mRNA produces A and B monomers that combine to produce functional AA, AB and BB receptors with distinct characteristics. A 7TM receptor responsive to estrogen (GPER1, Q99527, also known as GPR30, see ) has been described. Human orthologues of 7TM 'membrane progestin receptors' (PAQR7, PAQR8 and PAQR5), initially discovered in fish , appear to localize to intracellular membranes and respond to 'non-genomic' progesterone analogues independently of G proteins.",

      "description": "Catalytic receptors are cell-surface proteins, usually dimeric in nature, which encompass ligand binding and functional domains in one polypeptide chain. The ligand binding domain is placed on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane and separated from the functional domain by a single transmembrane-spanning domain of 20-25 hydrophobic amino acids. The functional domain on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane has catalytic activity, or interacts with particular enzymes, giving the superfamily of receptors its name. Endogenous agonists of the catalytic receptor superfamily are peptides or proteins, the binding of which may induce dimerization of the receptor, which is the functional version of the receptor.Amongst the catalytic receptors, particular subfamilies may be readily identified dependent on the function of the enzymatic portion of the receptor. The smallest group is the particulate guanylyl cyclases of the natriuretic peptide receptor family. The most widely recognized group is probably the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, epitomized by the neurotrophin receptor family, where a crucial initial step is the activation of a signalling cascade by autophosphorylation of the receptor on intracellular tyrosine residue(s) catalyzed by enzyme activity intrinsic to the receptor. A third group is the extrinsic protein tyrosine kinase receptors, where the catalytic activity resides in a separate protein from the binding site. Examples of this group include the GDNF and ErbB receptor families, where one, catalytically silent, member of the heterodimer is activated upon binding the ligand, causing the second member of the heterodimer, lacking ligand binding capacity, to initiate signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation. A fourth group, the receptor threonine/serine kinase (RTSK) family, exemplified by TGF-β and BMP receptors, has intrinsic serine/threonine protein kinase activity in the heterodimeric functional unit. A fifth group is the receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RTP), which appear to lack cognate ligands, but may be triggered by events such as cell:cell contact and have identified roles in the skeletal, hematopoietic and immune systems.A further group of catalytic receptors for the Guide is the integrins, which have roles in cell:cell communication, often associated with signaling in the blood.",

      "description": "Cytokines are not a clearly defined group of agents, other than having an impact on immune signalling pathways, although many cytokines have effects on other systems, such as in development. A feature of some cytokines, which allows them to be distinguished from hormones, is that they may be produced by â€œnon-secretoryâ€? cells, for example, endothelial cells. Within the cytokine receptor family, some subfamilies may be identified, which are described elsewhere in the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, receptors for the TNF family, the TGF-β family and the chemokines. Within this group of records are described Type I cytokine receptors, typified by interleukin receptors, and Type II cytokine receptors, exemplified by interferon receptors. These receptors possess a conserved extracellular region, known as the cytokine receptor homology domain (CHD), along with a range of other structural modules, including extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and fibronectin type III (FBNIII)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and intracellular homology domains. An unusual feature of this group of agents is the existence of soluble and decoy receptors. These bind cytokines without allowing signalling to occur. A further attribute is the production of endogenous antagonist molecules, which bind to the receptors selectively and prevent signalling. A commonality of these families of receptors is the ligand-induced homo- or hetero-oligomerisation, which results in the recruitment of intracellular protein partners to evoke cellular responses, particularly in inflammatory or haematopoietic signalling. Although not an exclusive signalling pathway, a common feature of the majority of cytokine receptors is activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. This cascade is based around the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the Janus kinases (JAK), which phosphorylate the receptor and thereby facilitate the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The activated homo- or heterodimeric STATs function principally as transcription factors in the nucleus.Type I cytokine receptors are characterized by two pairs of conserved cysteines linked via disulfide bonds and a C-terminal WSXWS motif within their CHD. Type I receptors are commonly classified into five groups, based on sequence and structual homology of the receptor and its cytokine ligand, which is potentially more reflective of evolutionary relationships than an earlier scheme based on the use of common signal transducing chains within a receptor complex.Type II cytokine receptors also have two pairs of conserved cysteines but with a different arrangement to Type I and also lack the WSXWS motif.",

PRRs express multiple leucine-rich regions to bind a range of microbially-derived ligands, termed PAMPs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns or endogenous ligands, termed DAMPS or damage-associated molecular patterns. These include peptides, carbohydrates, peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, and nucleic acids. PRRs include both cell-surface and intracellular proteins. PRRs may be divided into signalling-associated members, identified here, and endocytic members, the function of which appears to be to recognise particular microbial motifs for subsequent cell attachment, internalisation and destruction. Some are involved in inflammasome formation, and modulation of IL-1β cleavage and secretion, and others in the initiation of the type I interferon response.

This consists of an N-terminal effector domain, a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD; also referred to as a NACHT domain), and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR) which have regulatory and ligand recognition functions. The type of effector domain has resulted in the division of NLR family members into two major sub-families, NLRC and NLRP, along with three smaller sub-families NLRA, NLRB and NLRX. NLRC members express an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and NLRP members an N-terminal Pyrin domain (PYD).Upon activation the NLRC family members NOD1 (NLRC1) and NOD2 (NLRC2) recruit a serine/threonine kinase RIPK2 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2, O43353, also known as CARD3, CARDIAK, RICK, RIP2) leading to signalling through NFκB and MAP kinase. Activation of NLRC4 (previously known as IPAF) and members of the NLRP3 family, including NLRP1 and NLRP3, leads to formation of a large multiprotein complex known as the inflammasome. In addition to NLR proteins other key members of the inflammasome include the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD, also known as PYCARD, CARD5, TMS1, Q9ULZ3) and inflammatory caspases. The inflammasome activates the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18.",

Therefore, members of this signaling pathway are subject to investigation as intervention points for pharmacological inhibition. Initial investigations targeted IFN-I downstream signaling, including IFN-I proteins, IFNAR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. For example, sifalimumab (anti-IFN-α mAb), anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR1) and the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, can all potentially tackle the effector function of dysregulated IFN by blocking downstream IFN-I signaling, but do not contribute to reducing the production of IFN. Upstream targeting of TBK1 and/or IKKε could be effective at blocking de novo IFN-I induction by a variety of stimuli. Small molecule kinase inhibitors of TBK1/IKKε already in development for cancer may expedite investigation for inflammatory diseases also.",

      "description": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a family of cell-surface receptors, which transduce signals to polypeptide and protein hormones, cytokines and growth factors are key regulators of critical cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation, cell survival and metabolism, cell migration and cell cycle control. In the human genome, 58 RTKs have been identified, which fall into 20 families. All RTKs display an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a cytoplasmic region containing the protein tyrosine kinase activity (occasionally split into two domains by an insertion, termed the kinase insertion), with juxta-membrane and C-terminal regulatory regions. Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-γ, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.  RTKs are of widespread interest not only through physiological functions, but also as drug targets in many types of cancer and other disease states. Many diseases result from genetic changes or abnormalities that either alter the activity, abundance, cellular distribution and/or regulation of RTKs. Therefore, drugs that modify the dysregulated functions of these RTKs have been developed which fall into two categories. One group is often described as â€˜biologicalsâ€™, which block the activation of RTKs directly or by chelating the cognate ligands, while the second are small molecules designed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity directly.",

HER/ErbB is the viral counterpart to the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR. All family members heterodimerize with each other to activate downstream signalling pathways and are aberrantly expressed in many cancers, particularly forms of breast cancer and lung cancer.

Exceptionally amongst the catalytic receptors, the functional receptor in the insulin receptor family is derived from a single gene product, cleaved post-translationally into two peptides, which then cross-link via disulphide bridges to form a heterotetramer. Intriguingly, the endogenous peptide ligands are formed in a parallel fashion with post-translational processing producing a heterodimer linked by disulphide bridges. Signalling through the receptors is mediated through a rapid autophosphorylation event at intracellular tyrosine residues, followed by recruitment of multiple adaptor proteins, notably IRS1 (P35568), IRS2 (Q9Y4H2), SHC1 (P29353), GRB2 (P62993) and SOS1 (Q07889).Serum levels of free IGFs are kept low by the action of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1-5, P08833, P18065, P17936, P22692, P24593), which sequester the IGFs; overexpression of IGFBPs may induce apoptosis, while IGFBP levels are also altered in some cancers.",

Agonist binding initiates formation of a cell-surface complex of type I and type II RSTK, possibly heterotetrameric, where both subunits express serine/threonine kinase activity. The type I receptor serine/threonine kinases are also known as activin receptors or activin receptor-like kinases, ALKs, for which a systematic nomenclature has been proposed (ALK1-7). The type II protein phosphorylates the kinase domain of the type I partner (sometimes referred to as the signal propagating subunit), causing displacement of the protein partners, such as the FKBP12 FK506-binding protein FKBP1A (P62942) and allowing the binding and phosphorylation of particular members of the Smad family. These migrate to the nucleus and act as complexes to regulate gene transcription. Type III receptors, sometimes called co-receptors or accessory proteins, regulate the signalling of the receptor complex, in either enhancing (for example, presenting the ligand to the receptor) or inhibitory manners. TGFβ family ligand signalling may be inhibited by endogenous proteins, such as follistatin, which binds and neutralizes activins to prevent activation of the target receptors.Endogenous agonists, approximately 30 in man, are often described as paracrine messengers acting close to the source of production. They are characterized by six conserved cysteine residues and are divided into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence comparison and signalling pathways activated, the TGFβ/activin/nodal subfamily and the BMP/GDF (growth/differentiation factor)/MIS (Müllerian inhibiting substance) subfamily. Ligands active at RSTKs appear to be generated as large precursors which undergo complex maturation processes. Some are known to form disulphide-linked homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes. Thus, inhibins are α subunits linked to a variety of β chains, while activins are combinations of β subunits.",

The intracellular signalling cascades associated with integrin activation focus on protein kinase activities, such as focal adhesion kinase and Src. Based on this association between extracellular signals and intracellular protein kinase activity, we have chosen to include integrins in the 'Catalytic receptors' section of the database until more stringent criteria from NC-IUPHAR allows precise definition of their classification.Integrins are heterodimeric entities, composed of α and β subunits, each 1TM proteins, which bind components of the extracellular matrix or counter-receptors expressed on other cells. One class of integrin contains an inserted domain (I) in its α subunit, and if present (in α1, α2, α10, α11, αD, αE, αL, αM and αX), this I domain contains the ligand binding site. All β subunits possess a similar I-like domain, which has the capacity to bind ligand, often recognising the RGD motif. The presence of an α subunit I domain precludes ligand binding through the β subunit. Integrins provide a link between ligand and the actin cytoskeleton (through typically short intracellular domains). Integrins bind several divalent cations, including a Mg2+ ion in the I or I-like domain that is essential for ligand binding. Other cation binding sites may regulate integrin activity or stabilise the 3D structure. Integrins regulate the activity of particular protein kinases, including focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase. Cellular activation regulates integrin ligand affinity via inside-out signalling and ligand binding to integrins can regulate cellular activity via outside-in signalling.Several drugs that target integrins are in clinical use including: (1) abciximab (αIIbβ3) for short term prevention of coronary thrombosis, (2) vedolizumab (α4β7) to reduce gastrointestinal inflammation, and (3) natalizumab (α4β1) in some cases of severe multiple sclerosis.",

Many ion channels (such as most Na, K, Ca and some Cl channels) are gated by voltage but others (such as certain K and Cl channels, TRP channels, ryanodine receptors and IP3 receptors) are relatively voltage-insensitive and are gated by second messengers and other intracellular and/or extracellular mediators. As such, there is some blurring of the boundaries between \"ion channels\" and \"ligand-gated channels\" which are compiled separately in the Guide. Resolution of ion channel structures, beginning with K channels then Cl channels and most recently Na channels has greatly improved understanding of the structural basis behind ion channel function. Many ion channels (e.g., K, Na, Ca, HCN and TRP channels) share several structural similarities. These channels are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor and have been classfied together as the \"voltage-gated-like (VGL) ion channel chanome\" (see ). Other ion channels, however, such as Cl channels, aquaporins and connexins, have completely different structural properties to the VGL channels, having evolved quite separately.Currently, ion channels (including ligand-gated ion channels) represent the second largest target for existing drugs after G protein-coupled receptors. However, the advent of novel, faster screening techniques for compounds acting on ion channels suggests that these proteins represent promising targets for the development of additional, novel therapeutic agents for the near future.",

      "description": "The voltage-gated ion channels and their structural relatives comprise a superfamily encoded by at least 143 genes in the human genome and are therefore one of the largest superfamilies of signal transduction proteins, following the G protein-coupled receptors and the protein kinases in number. In addition to their prominence in signal transduction, these ion channels are also among the most common drug targets. As for other large protein superfamilies, understanding the molecular relationships among family members, developing a unified, rational nomenclature for the ion channel families and subfamilies, and assigning physiological functions and pharmacological significance to each family member has been an important challenge. Some of the ion channels placed under the 'Voltage-gated' umbrella are not in fact gated by voltage, but for the reasons mentioned above it is useful to consider them within this superfamily. The inwardly rectifying potassium channels, two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), ryanodine receptors (RyR) and transient receptor potential channels (TRP) are those that are NOT voltage-gated.",

In mammals, CatSper subunits are structurally most closely related to individual domains of voltage-activated calcium channels (Cav). CatSper1 , CatSper2 and CatSpers 3 and 4 , in common with a putative 2TM auxiliary CatSperβ protein and two putative 1TM associated CatSperγ and CatSperδ proteins , are restricted to the testis and localised to the principle piece of sperm tail. The novel cross-species CatSper channel inhibitor, RU1968, has been proposed as a useful tool to aid characterisation of native CatSper channels.Two-pore channels (TPCs) are structurally related to CatSpers, CaVs and NaVs. TPCs have a 2x6TM structure with twice the number of TMs of CatSpers and half that of CaVs. There are three animal TPCs (TPC1-TPC3). Humans have TPC1 and TPC2, but not TPC3. TPC1 and TPC2 are localized in endosomes and lysosomes. TPC3 is also found on the plasma membrane and forms a voltage-activated, non-inactivating Na+ channel. All the three TPCs are Na+-selective under whole-cell or whole-organelle patch clamp recording. The channels may also conduct Ca2+.",

      "description": "Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are responsible for signalling in the primary sensory cells of the vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. CNG channels are voltage-independent cation channels formed as tetramers. Each subunit has 6TM, with the pore-forming domain between TM5 and TM6. CNG channels were first found in rod photoreceptors , where light signals through rhodopsin and transducin to stimulate phosphodiesterase and reduce intracellular cyclic GMP level. This results in a closure of CNG channels and a reduced â€˜dark currentâ€™. Similar channels were found in the cilia of olfactory neurons and the pineal gland. The cyclic nucleotides bind to a domain in the C terminus of the subunit protein: other channels directly binding cyclic nucleotides include hyperolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN), ether-a-go-go and certain plant potassium channels.The HCN channels are cation channels that are activated by hyperpolarisation at voltages negative to ~-50 mV. The cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP directly bind to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of HCN channels and shift their activation curves to more positive voltages, thereby enhancing channel activity. HCN channels underlie pacemaker currents found in many excitable cells including cardiac cells and neurons. In native cells, these currents have a variety of names, such as Ih, Iq and If. The four known HCN channels have six transmembrane domains and form tetramers. It is believed that the channels can form heteromers with each other, as has been shown for HCN1 and HCN4. High resolution structural studies of CNG and HCN channels has provided insight into the the gating processes of these channels. A standardised nomenclature for CNG and HCN channels has been proposed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on voltage-gated ion channels.",

      "description": "The TRP superfamily of channels (nomenclature as agreed by NC-IUPHAR ), whose founder member is the Drosophila Trp channel, exists in mammals as six families; TRPC, TRPM, TRPV, TRPA, TRPP and TRPML based on amino acid homologies. TRP subunits contain six putative TM domains and assemble as homo- or hetero-tetramers to form cation selective channels with diverse modes of activation and varied permeation properties (reviewed by ). Established, or potential, physiological functions of the individual members of the TRP families are discussed in detail in the recommended reviews and in a number of books. The established, or potential, involvement of TRP channels in disease is reviewed in , and , together with a special edition of Biochemica et Biophysica Acta on the subject. Additional disease related reviews, for pain , stroke , sensation and inflammation , itch , and airway disease , are available. The pharmacology of most TRP channels has been advanced in recent years. Broad spectrum agents are listed in the tables along with more selective, or recently recognised, ligands that are flagged by the inclusion of a primary reference. See Rubaiy (2019) for a review of pharmacological tools for TRPC1/C4/C5 channels. Most TRP channels are regulated by phosphoinostides such as PtIns(4,5)P2  although the effects reported are often complex, occasionally contradictory, and likely to be dependent upon experimental conditions, such as intracellular ATP levels (reviewed by ). Such regulation is generally not included in the tables.When thermosensitivity is mentioned, it refers specifically to a high Q10 of gating, often in the range of 10-30, but does not necessarily imply that the channel's function is to act as a 'hot' or 'cold' sensor. In general, the search for TRP activators has led to many claims for temperature sensing, mechanosensation, and lipid sensing. All proteins are of course sensitive to energies of binding, mechanical force, and temperature, but the issue is whether the proposed input is within a physiologically relevant range resulting in a response. TRPA (ankyrin) familyTRPA1 is the sole mammalian member of this group (reviewed by ). TRPA1 activation of sensory neurons contribute to nociception. Pungent chemicals such as mustard oil (AITC), allicin, and cinnamaldehyde activate TRPA1 by modification of free thiol groups of cysteine side chains, especially those located in its amino terminus. Alkenals with α, β-unsaturated bonds, such as propenal , butenal , and 2-pentenal can react with free thiols via Michael addition and can activate TRPA1. However, potency appears to weaken as carbon chain length increases. Covalent modification leads to sustained activation of TRPA1. Chemicals including carvacrol, menthol, and local anesthetics reversibly activate TRPA1 by non-covalent binding. TRPA1 is not mechanosensitive under physiological conditions, but can be activated by cold temperatures. The electron cryo-EM structure of TRPA1 indicates that it is a 6-TM homotetramer. Each subunit of the channel contains two short â€˜pore helicesâ€™ pointing into the ion selectivity filter, which is big enough to allow permeation of partially hydrated Ca2+ ions. TRPC (canonical) familyMembers of the TRPC subfamily (reviewed by ) fall into the subgroups outlined below. TRPC2 is a pseudogene in humans. It is generally accepted that all TRPC channels are activated downstream of Gq/11-coupled receptors, or receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed by ). A comprehensive listing of G-protein coupled receptors that activate TRPC channels is given in. Hetero-oligomeric complexes of TRPC channels and their association with proteins to form signalling complexes are detailed in and. TRPC channels have frequently been proposed to act as store-operated channels (SOCs) (or compenents of mulimeric complexes that form SOCs), activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (reviewed by ). However, the weight of the evidence is that they are not directly gated by conventional store-operated mechanisms, as established for Stim-gated Orai channels. TRPC channels are not mechanically gated in physiologically relevant ranges of force. All members of the TRPC family are blocked by 2-APB and SKF96365. Activation of TRPC channels by lipids is discussed by. Important progress has been recently made in TRPC pharmacology. TRPC channels regulate a variety of physiological functions and are implicated in many human diseases. TRPC1/C4/C5 subgroup TRPC1 alone may not form a functional ion channel. The structures of the apo and antagonist-bound states of TRPC1/TRPC4 heteromeric channels have been resolved by cryo-EM. TRPC4/C5 may be distinguished from other TRP channels by their potentiation by micromolar concentrations of La3+. TRPC2 is a pseudogene in humans, but in other mammals appears to be an ion channel localized to microvilli of the vomeronasal organ. It is required for normal sexual behavior in response to pheromones in mice. It may also function in the main olfactory epithelia in mice.TRPC3/C6/C7 subgroup All members are activated by diacylglycerol independent of protein kinase C stimulation.TRPM (melastatin) familyMembers of the TRPM subfamily (reviewed by ) fall into the five subgroups outlined below. TRPM1/M3 subgroupIn darkness, glutamate released by the photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells binds to the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 , leading to activation of Go. This results in the closure of TRPM1. When the photoreceptors are stimulated by light, glutamate release is reduced, and TRPM1 channels are more active, resulting in cell membrane depolarization. Human TRPM1 mutations are associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), whose patients lack rod function. TRPM1 is also found melanocytes. Isoforms of TRPM1 may present in melanocytes, melanoma, brain, and retina. In melanoma cells, TRPM1 is prevalent in highly dynamic intracellular vesicular structures. TRPM3 (reviewed by ) exists as multiple splice variants which differ significantly in their biophysical properties. TRPM3 is expressed in somatosensory neurons and may be important in development of heat hyperalgesia during inflammation (see review ). TRPM3 is frequently coexpressed with TRPA1 and TRPV1 in these neurons. TRPM3 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells as well as brain, pituitary gland, eye, kidney, and adipose tissue. TRPM3 may contribute to the detection of noxious heat. TRPM2TRPM2 is activated under conditions of oxidative stress (respiratory burst of phagocytic cells). The direct activators are calcium, adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) and cyclic ADPR. As for many ion channels, PI(4,5)P2 must also be present. Numerous splice variants of TRPM2 exist which differ in their activation mechanisms. Recent studies have reported structures of human (hs) TRPM2, which demonstrate two ADPR binding sites in hsTRPM2, one in the N-terminal MHR1/2 domain and the other in the C-terminal NUDT9-H domain. In addition, one Ca2+ binding site in the intracellular S2-S3 loop is revealed and proposed to mediate Ca2+ binding that induces conformational changes leading the ADPR-bound closed channel to open. Meanwhile, a quadruple-residue motif (979FGQI982) was identified as the ion selectivity filter and a gate to control ion permeation in hsTRPM2. TRPM2 is involved in warmth sensation , and contributes to several diseases. TRPM2 interacts with extra synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and enhances NMDAR activity in ischemic stroke. Activation of TRPM2 in macrophages promotes atherosclerosis. Moreover, silica nanoparticles induce lung inflammation in mice via ROS/PARP/TRPM2 signaling-mediated lysosome impairment and autophagy dysfunction. Recent studies have designed various compounds for their potential to selectively inhibit the TRPM2 channel, including ACA derivatives A23, and 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one derivatives. TRPM4/5 subgroupTRPM4 and TRPM5 have the distinction within all TRP channels of being impermeable to Ca2+. A splice variant of TRPM4 (i.e.TRPM4b) and TRPM5 are molecular candidates for endogenous calcium-activated cation (CAN) channels. TRPM4 is active in the late phase of repolarization of the cardiac ventricular action potential. TRPM4 deletion or knockout enhances beta adrenergic-mediated inotropy. Mutations are associated with conduction defects. TRPM4 has been shown to be an important regulator of Ca2+ entry in to mast cells and dendritic cell migration. TRPM5 in taste receptor cells of the tongue appears essential for the transduction of sweet, amino acid and bitter stimuli TRPM5 contributes to the slow afterdepolarization of layer 5 neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex. Both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required transduction of taste stimuli. TRPM6/7 subgroupTRPM6 and 7 combine channel and enzymatic activities (â€˜chanzymesâ€™). These channels have the unusual property of permeation by divalent (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+) and monovalent cations, high single channel conductances, but overall extremely small inward conductance when expressed to the plasma membrane. They are inhibited by internal Mg2+ at ~0.6 mM, around the free level of Mg2+ in cells. Whether they contribute to Mg2+ homeostasis is a contentious issue. PIP2 is required for TRPM6 and TRPM7 activation. When either gene is deleted in mice, the result is embryonic lethality. The C-terminal kinase region of TRPM6 and TRPM7 is cleaved under unknown stimuli, and the kinase phosphorylates nuclear histones. TRPM7 is responsible for oxidant- induced Zn2+ release from intracellular vesicles and contributes to intestinal mineral absorption essential for postnatal survival. The putative metal transporter proteins CNNM1-4 interact with TRPM7 and regulate TRPM7 channel activity. TRPM8Is a channel activated by cooling and pharmacological agents evoking a â€˜coolâ€™ sensation and participates in the thermosensation of cold temperatures reviewed by. Direct chemical agonists include menthol and icilin. Besides, linalool can promote ERK phosphorylation in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, down-regulate intracellular ATP levels, and activate TRPM8. Recent studies have found that TRPM8 has typical S4-S5 connectomes with clear selective filters and exowell rings , and have identified cryo-electron microscopy structures of mouse TRPM8 in closed, intermediate, and open states along the ligand- and PIP2-dependent gated pathways. Moreover, the last 36 amino acids at the carboxyl terminal of TRPM8 are key protein sequences for TRPM8's temperature-sensitive function. TRPM8 deficiency reduced the expression of S100A9 and increased the expression of HNF4α in the liver of mice, which reduced inflammation and fibrosis progression in mice with liver fibrosis, and helped to alleviate the symptoms of bile duct disease. Channel deficiency also shortens the time of hypersensitivity reactions in migraine mouse models by promoting the recovery of normal sensitivity. A cyclic peptide DeCâ€?1.2 was designed to inhibit ligand activation of TRPM8 but not cold activation, which can eliminate the side effects of cold dysalgesia in oxaliplatin-treated mice without changing body temperature. Analysis of clinical data shows that TRPM8-specific blockers WS12 can reduce tumor growth in colorectal cancer xenografted mice by reducing transcription and activation of Wnt signaling regulators and β-catenin and its target oncogenes, such as C-Myc and Cyclin D1. TRPML (mucolipin) familyThe TRPML family consists of three mammalian members (TRPML1-3). TRPML channels are probably restricted to intracellular vesicles and mutations in the gene (MCOLN1) encoding TRPML1 (mucolipin-1) cause the neurodegenerative disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) in man. TRPML1 is a cation selective ion channel that is important for sorting/transport of endosomes in the late endocytotic pathway and specifically, fission from late endosome-lysosome hybrid vesicles and lysosomal exocytosis. TRPML2 and TRPML3 show increased channel activity in low luminal sodium and/or increased luminal pH, and are activated by similar small molecules. A naturally occurring gain of function mutation in TRPML3 (i.e. A419P) results in the varitint waddler (Va) mouse phenotype (reviewed by ). TRPP (polycystin) familyThe TRPP family (reviewed by ) or PKD2 family is comprised of PKD2 (PC2), PKD2L1 (PC2L1), PKD2L2 (PC2L2), which have been renamed TRPP1, TRPP2 and TRPP3, respectively. It should also be noted that the nomenclature of PC2 was TRPP2 in old literature. However, PC2 has been uniformed to be called TRPP2. PKD2 family channels are clearly distinct from the PKD1 family, whose function is unknown. PKD1 and PKD2 form a hetero-oligomeric complex with a 1:3 ratio.. Although still being sorted out, TRPP family members appear to be 6TM spanning nonselective cation channels. TRPV (vanilloid) familyMembers of the TRPV family (reviewed by ) can broadly be divided into the non-selective cation channels, TRPV1-4 and the more calcium selective channels TRPV5 and TRPV6. TRPV1-V4 subfamilyTRPV1 is involved in the development of thermal hyperalgesia following inflammation and may contribute to the detection of noxius heat (reviewed by ). Numerous splice variants of TRPV1 have been described, some of which modulate the activity of TRPV1, or act in a dominant negative manner when co-expressed with TRPV1. The pharmacology of TRPV1 channels is discussed in detail in and. TRPV2 is probably not a thermosensor in man , but has recently been implicated in innate immunity. Functional TRPV2 expression is described in placental trophoblast cells of mouse. TRPV3 and TRPV4 are both thermosensitive. There are claims that TRPV4 is also mechanosensitive, but this has not been established to be within a physiological range in a native environment. TRPV5/V6 subfamily TRPV5 and TRPV6 are highly expressed in placenta, bone, and kidney. Under physiological conditions, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are calcium selective channels involved in the absorption and reabsorption of calcium across intestinal and kidney tubule epithelia (reviewed by ).TRPV6 is reported to play a key role in calcium transport in the mouse placenta.",

The α1 subunit is pore-forming and provides the binding site(s) for practically all agonists and antagonists. The 10 cloned α1-subunits can be grouped into three families: (1) the high-voltage activated dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type, CaV1.x) channels; (2) the high- to moderate-voltage activated dihydropyridine-insensitive (CaV2.x) channels and (3) the low-voltage-activated (T-type, CaV3.x) channels. Each α1 subunit has four homologous repeats (I-IV), each repeat having six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and a pore-forming region between S5 and S6. Voltage-dependent gating is driven by the membrane spanning S4 segment, which contains highly conserved positive charges that respond to changes in membrane potential. All of the α1-subunit genes give rise to alternatively spliced products. At least for high-voltage activated channels, it is likely that native channels comprise co-assemblies of α1, β and α2-δ subunits. The γ subunits have not been proven to associate with channels other than the α1s skeletal muscle Cav1.1 channel. The α2-δ1 and α2-δ2 subunits bind gabapentin and pregabalin.",

The structure of Hv1 is homologous to the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels (i.e. segments S1 to S4) and contains no discernable pore region. Proton flux through Hv1 is instead most likely mediated by a hydrogen-bonded chain formed in a crevice of the protein when the voltage-sensing S4 helix moves in response to a change in transmembrane potential. Proton selective conduction requires an aspartate residue at the center of the pore. Both selectivity and conduction may result from obligatory protonation by each conducted proton. Hv1 expresses largely as a dimer mediated by intracellular C-terminal coiled-coil interactions but individual promoters nonetheless support gated H+ flux via separate conduction pathways. Within dimeric structures, the two protomers do not function independently, but display co-operative interactions during gating resulting in increased voltage sensitivity, but slower activation, of the dimeric, versus monomeric, complexes. The otopetrin proteins appear to form proton-selective ion channels and to date 3 subtypes have been identified in eukaryotes; otopetrin 1 , otopetrin 2 and otopetrin 3.",

      "description": "The 4TM family of K channels mediate many of the background potassium currents observed in native cells. They are open across the physiological voltage-range and are regulated by a wide array of neurotransmitters and biochemical mediators. The pore-forming α-subunit contains two pore loop (P) domains and two subunits assemble to form one ion conduction pathway lined by four P domains. It is important to note that single channels do not have two pores but that each subunit has two P domains in its primary sequence; hence the name two-pore domain, or K2P channels (and not two-pore channels). Some of the K2P subunits can form heterodimers across subfamilies (e.g. K2P3.1 with K2P9.1). The nomenclature of 4TM K channels in the literature is still a mixture of IUPHAR and common names. The suggested division into subfamilies, described in the More detailed introduction, is based on similarities in both structural and functional properties within subfamilies and this explains the \"common abbreviation\" nomenclature in the tables below.",

      "description": "Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are integral membrane proteins that contain a pore which allows the regulated flow of selected ions across the plasma membrane. Ion flux is passive and driven by the electrochemical gradient for the permeant ions. These channels are open, or gated, by the binding of a neurotransmitter to an orthosteric site(s) that triggers a conformational change that results in the conducting state. Modulation of gating can occur by the binding of endogenous, or exogenous, modulators to allosteric sites. LGICs mediate fast synaptic transmission, on a millisecond time scale, in the nervous system and at the somatic neuromuscular junction. Such transmission involves the release of a neurotransmitter from a pre-synaptic neurone and the subsequent activation of post-synaptically located receptors that mediate a rapid, phasic, electrical signal (the excitatory, or inhibitory, post-synaptic potential). However, in addition to their traditional role in phasic neurotransmission, it is now established that some LGICs mediate a tonic form of neuronal regulation that results from the activation of extra-synaptic receptors by ambient levels of neurotransmitter. The expression of some LGICs by non-excitable cells is suggestive of additional functions.By convention, the LGICs comprise the excitatory, cation-selective, nicotinic acetylcholine , 5-HT3 , ionotropic glutamate and P2X receptors and the inhibitory, anion-selective, GABAA and glycine receptors. The nicotinic acetylcholine, 5-HT3, GABAA and glycine receptors (and an additional zinc-activated channel) are pentameric structures and are frequently referred to as the Cys-loop receptors due to the presence of a defining loop of residues formed by a disulphide bond in the extracellular domain of their constituent subunits. However, the prokaryotic ancestors of these receptors contain no such loop and the term pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) is gaining acceptance in the literature. The ionotropic glutamate and P2X receptors are tetrameric and trimeric structures, respectively. Multiple genes encode the subunits of LGICs and the majority of these receptors are heteromultimers. Such combinational diversity results, within each class of LGIC, in a wide range of receptors with differing pharmacological and biophysical properties and varying patterns of expression within the nervous system and other tissues. The LGICs thus present attractive targets for new therapeutic agents with improved discrimination between receptor isoforms and a reduced propensity for off-target effects. The development of novel, faster screening techniques for compounds acting on LGICs will greatly aid in the development of such agents.",

The receptor exists as a pentamer of 4 transmembrane (TM) subunits that form an intrinsic cation selective channel. Five human 5-HT3 receptor subunits have been cloned and homo-oligomeric assemblies of 5-HT3A and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits have been characterised in detail. The 5-HT3C (HTR3C, Q8WXA8), 5-HT3D (HTR3D, Q70Z44) and 5-HT3E (HTR3E, A5X5Y0) subunits , like the 5-HT3B subunit, do not form functional homomers, but are reported to assemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to influence its functional expression rather than pharmacological profile. 5-HT3A, -C, -D, and -E subunits also interact with the chaperone RIC-3 which predominantly enhances the surface expression of homomeric 5-HT3A receptor. The co-expression of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3C-E subunits has been demonstrated in human colon. A recombinant hetero-oligomeric 5-HT3AB receptor has been reported to contain two copies of the 5-HT3A subunit and three copies of the 5-HT3B subunit in the order B-B-A-B-A , but this is inconsistent with recent reports which show at least one A-A interface. The 5-HT3B subunit imparts distinctive biophysical properties upon hetero-oligomeric 5-HT3AB versus homo-oligomeric 5-HT3A recombinant receptors , influences the potency of channel blockers, but generally has only a modest effect upon the apparent affinity of agonists, or the affinity of antagonists (, but see ) which may be explained by the orthosteric binding site residing at an interface formed between 5-HT3A subunits. However, 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors differ in their allosteric regulation by some general anaesthetic agents, small alcohols and indoles. The potential diversity of 5-HT3 receptors is increased by alternative splicing of the genes HTR3A and HTR3E. In addition, the use of tissue-specific promoters driving expression from different transcriptional start sites has been reported for the HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3D and HTR3E genes, which could result in 5-HT3 subunits harbouring different N-termini. To date, inclusion of the 5-HT3A subunit appears imperative for 5-HT3 receptor function.",

      "description": "The GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel of the Cys-loop family that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, 5-HT3 and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors. GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition within the CNS occurs by fast synaptic transmission, sustained tonic inhibition and temporally intermediate events that have been termed 'GABAA, slow'. GABAA receptors exist as pentamers of 4TM subunits that form an intrinsic anion selective channel. Sequences of six α, three β, three γ, one δ, three ρ, one ε, one π and one θ GABAA receptor subunits have been reported in mammals. The π-subunit is restricted to reproductive tissue. Alternatively spliced versions of many subunits exist (e.g. α4- and α6- (both not functional) α5-, β2-, β3- and γ2), along with RNA editing of the α3 subunit. The three ρ-subunits, (ρ1-3) function as either homo- or hetero-oligomeric assemblies. Receptors formed from ρ-subunits, because of their distinctive pharmacology that includes insensitivity to bicuculline, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have sometimes been termed GABAC receptors , but they are classified as GABAA receptors by NC-IUPHAR on the basis of structural and functional criteria .Many GABAA receptor subtypes contain α-, β- and γ-subunits with the likely stoichiometry 2α.2β.1γ. It is thought that the majority of GABAA receptors harbour a single type of α- and β -subunit variant. The α1β2γ2 hetero-oligomer constitutes the largest population of GABAA receptors in the CNS, followed by the α2β3γ2 and α3β3γ2 isoforms. Receptors that incorporate the α4- α5-or α6-subunit, or the β1-, γ1-, γ3-, δ-, ε- and θ-subunits, are less numerous, but they may nonetheless serve important functions. For example, extrasynaptically located receptors that contain α6- and δ-subunits in cerebellar granule cells, or an α4- and δ-subunit in dentate gyrus granule cells and thalamic neurones, mediate a tonic current that is important for neuronal excitability in response to ambient concentrations of GABA. GABA binding occurs at the β+/α- subunit interface and the homologous γ+/α- subunits interface creates the benzodiazepine site. A second site for benzodiazepine binding has recently been postulated to occur at the α+/β- interface (; reviewed by ). The particular α-and γ-subunit isoforms exhibit marked effects on recognition and/or efficacy at the benzodiazepine site. Thus, receptors incorporating either α4- or α6-subunits are not recognised by â€˜classicalâ€™ benzodiazepines, such as flunitrazepam (but see ). The trafficking, cell surface expression, internalisation and function of GABAA receptors and their subunits are discussed in detail in several recent reviews but one point worthy of note is that receptors incorporating the γ2 subunit (except when associated with α5) cluster at the postsynaptic membrane (but may distribute dynamically between synaptic and extrasynaptic locations), whereas those incorporating the δ subunit appear to be exclusively extrasynaptic. NC-IUPHAR  class the GABAA receptors according to their subunit structure, pharmacology and receptor function. Currently, eleven native GABAA receptors are classed as conclusively identified (i.e., α1β2γ2, α2βγ2, α3βγ2, α4βγ2, α4β2δ, α4β3δ, α5βγ2, α6βγ2, α6β2δ, α6β3δ and ρ) with further receptor isoforms occurring with high probability, or only tentatively. It is beyond the scope of this Guide to discuss the pharmacology of individual GABAA receptor isoforms in detail; such information can be gleaned in the reviews. Agents that discriminate between α-subunit isoforms are noted in the table and additional agents that demonstrate selectivity between receptor isoforms, for example via β-subunit selectivity, are indicated in the text below. The distinctive agonist and antagonist pharmacology of ρ receptors is summarised in the table and additional aspects are reviewed in.Several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures have been described in which the full-length human α1β3γ2L GABAA receptor in lipid nanodiscs is bound to the channel-blocker picrotoxin, the competitive antagonist bicuculline, the agonist GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), and the classical benzodiazepines alprazolam and diazepam.",

      "description": "The inhibitory glycine receptor (nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Glycine Receptors) is a member of the Cys-loop superfamily of transmitter-gated ion channels that includes the GABAA, nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3 receptors and Zn2+- activated channels. The glycine receptor is expressed either as a homo-pentamer of α subunits, or a complex of 4α and 1β subunits , that contains an intrinsic anion channel. Four differentially expressed isoforms of the α-subunit (α1-α4) and one variant of the β-subunit (β1, GLRB, P48167) have been identified by genomic and cDNA cloning. Further diversity originates from alternative splicing of the primary gene transcripts for α1 (α1INS and α1del), α2 (α2A and α2B), α3 (α3S and α3L) and β (βΔ7) subunits and by mRNA editing of the α2 and α3 subunit. Both α2 splicing and α3 mRNA editing can produce subunits (i.e., α2B and α3P185L) with enhanced agonist sensitivity. Predominantly, the adult form of the receptor contains α1 (or α3) and β subunits whereas the immature form is mostly composed of only α2 subunits. The α4 subunit is a pseudogene in humans. High resolution molecular structures are available for α1 homomeric, α3 homomeric, and αβ hteromeric receptors in a variety of ligand-induced conformations. As in other Cys-loop receptors, the orthosteric binding site for agonists and the competitive antagonist strychnine is formed at the interfaces between the subunitsâ€™ extracellular domains. Inclusion of the β-subunit in the pentameric glycine receptor contributes to agonist binding, reduces single channel conductance and alters pharmacology. The β-subunit also anchors the receptor, via an amphipathic sequence within the large intracellular loop region, to gephyrin. This a cytoskeletal attachment protein that binds to a number of subsynaptic proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure and thus clusters and anchors hetero-oligomeric receptors to the synapse. G protein βγ subunits enhance the open state probability of native and recombinant glycine receptors by association with domains within the large intracellular loop. Intracellular chloride concentration modulates the kinetics of native and recombinant glycine receptors. Intracellular Ca2+ appears to increase native and recombinant glycine receptor affinity, prolonging channel open events, by a mechanism that does not involve phosphorylation. Extracellular Zn2+ potentiates GlyR function at nanomolar concentrations. and causes inhibition at higher micromolar concentrations (17).",

      "description": "The ionotropic glutamate receptors comprise members of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid) and kainate receptor classes, named originally according to their preferred, synthetic, agonist. Receptor heterogeneity within each class arises from the homo-oligomeric, or hetero-oligomeric, assembly of distinct subunits into cation-selective tetramers. Each subunit of the tetrameric complex comprises an extracellular amino terminal domain (ATD), an extracellular ligand binding domain (LBD), 3 TM domains (M1, M3 and M4), a channel lining re-entrant 'p-loop' (M2) located between M1 and M3 and an intracellular carboxy- terminal domain (CTD). The X-ray structure of a homomeric ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluA2- see below) has recently been solved at 3.6Å resolution and although providing the most complete structural information current available may not representative of the subunit arrangement of, for example, the heteromeric NMDA receptors. It is beyond the scope of this supplement to discuss the pharmacology of individual ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms in detail; such information can be gleaned from. Agents that discriminate between subunit isoforms are, where appropriate, noted in the tables and additional compounds that distinguish between receptor isoforms are indicated in the text below.The classification of glutamate receptor subunits has been re-addressed by NC-IUPHAR . The scheme developed recommends a nomenclature for ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits that is adopted here.NMDA receptorsNMDA receptors assemble as obligate heteromers that may be drawn from GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C, GluN2D, GluN3A and GluN3B subunits. Alternative splicing can generate eight isoforms of GluN1 with differing pharmacological properties. Various splice variants of GluN2B, 2C, 2D and GluN3A have also been reported. Activation of NMDA receptors containing GluN1 and GluN2 subunits requires the binding of two agonists, glutamate to the S1 and S2 regions of the GluN2 subunit and glycine to S1 and S2 regions of the GluN1 subunit. The minimal requirement for efficient functional expression of NMDA receptors in vitro is a di-heteromeric assembly of GluN1 and at least one GluN2 subunit variant, as a dimer of heterodimers arrangement in the extracellular domain. However, more complex tri-heteromeric assemblies, incorporating multiple subtypes of GluN2 subunit, or GluN3 subunits, can be generated in vitro and occur in vivo. The NMDA receptor channel commonly has a high relative permeability to Ca2+ and is blocked, in a voltage-dependent manner, by Mg2+ such that at resting potentials the response is substantially inhibited.AMPA and Kainate receptorsAMPA receptors assemble as homomers, or heteromers, that may be drawn from GluA1, GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4 subunits. Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) of class I (i.e. γ2, γ3, γ4 and γ8) act, with variable stoichiometry, as auxiliary subunits to AMPA receptors and influence their trafficking, single channel conductance gating and pharmacology (reviewed in ). Functional kainate receptors can be expressed as homomers of GluK1, GluK2 or GluK3 subunits. GluK1-3 subunits are also capable of assembling into heterotetramers (e.g. GluK1/K2; ). Two additional kainate receptor subunits, GluK4 and GluK5, when expressed individually, form high affinity binding sites for kainate, but lack function, but can form heteromers when expressed with GluK1-3 subunits (e.g. GluK2/K5; reviewed in ). Kainate receptors may also exhibit 'metabotropic' functions. As found for AMPA receptors, kainate receptors are modulated by auxiliary subunits (Neto proteins, ). An important function difference between AMPA and kainate receptors is that the latter require extracellular Na+ and Cl- for their activation. RNA encoding the GluA2 subunit undergoes extensive RNA editing in which the codon encoding a p-loop glutamine residue (Q) is converted to one encoding arginine (R). This Q/R site strongly influences the biophysical properties of the receptor. Recombinant AMPA receptors lacking RNA edited GluA2 subunits are: (1) permeable to Ca2+; (2) blocked by intracellular polyamines at depolarized potentials causing inward rectification (the latter being reduced by TARPs); (3) blocked by extracellular argiotoxin and joro spider toxins and (4) demonstrate higher channel conductances than receptors containing the edited form of GluA2. GluK1 and GluK2, but not other kainate receptor subunits, are similarly edited and broadly similar functional characteristics apply to kainate receptors lacking either an RNA edited GluK1, or GluK2, subunit. Native AMPA and kainate receptors displaying differential channel conductances, Ca2+ permeabilites and sensitivity to block by intracellular polyamines have been identified. GluA1-4 can exist as two variants generated by alternative splicing (termed â€˜flipâ€™ and â€˜flopâ€™) that differ in their desensitization kinetics and their desensitization in the presence of cyclothiazide which stabilises the nondesensitized state. TARPs also stabilise the non-desensitized conformation of AMPA receptors and facilitate the action of cyclothiazide. Splice variants of GluK1-3 also exist which affects their trafficking.",

      "description": "Nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors are members of the Cys-loop family of transmitter-gated ion channels that includes the GABAA, strychnine-sensitive glycine and 5-HT3 receptors. All nicotinic receptors are pentamers in which each of the five subunits contains 4 TM domains. Genes encoding a total of 17 subunits (α1-10, β1-4, γ, δ and ε) have been identified. All subunits with the exception of α8 (present in avian species) have been identified in mammals. All α subunits possess two tandem cysteine residues near to the site involved in acetylcholine binding, and subunits not named α lack these residues. The orthosteric ligand binding site is formed by residues within at least three peptide domains on the α subunit (principal component), and three on the adjacent subunit (complementary component). Nicotinic ACh receptors contain several allosteric modulatory sites. One such site, for positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and allosteric agonists, has been proposed to reside within an intrasubunit cavity between the 4 TM domains ; see also ). The high resolution crystal structure of the molluscan ACh binding protein, a structural homologue of the extracellular binding domain of a nicotinic receptor pentamer, in complex with several nicotinic receptor ligands (e.g.) and the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the α1 subunit bound to α-bungarotoxin at 1.94Â resolution , has revealed the orthosteric binding site in detail (reviewed in ). Nicotinic receptors at the somatic neuromuscular junction of adult animals have the stoichiometry (α1)2β1δε, whereas an extrajunctional (α1)2β1γδ receptor predominates in embryonic and denervated skeletal muscle and other pathological states. Other nicotinic receptors are assembled as combinations of α(2-6) and β(2-4) subunits. For α2, α3, α4 and β2 and β4 subunits, pairwise combinations of α and β (e.g. α3β4 and α4β2) are sufficient to form a functional receptor in vitro, but far more complex isoforms may exist in vivo (reviewed in ). There is strong evidence that the pairwise assembly of some α and β subunits can occur with variable stoichiometry [e.g. (α4)2(β2)2 or (α4)3(β2)2] which influences the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the receptor. α5 and β3 subunits lack function when expressed alone, or pairwise, but participate in the formation of functional hetero-oligomeric receptors when expressed as a third subunit with another α and β pair [e.g. α4α5αβ2, α4αβ2β3, α5α6β2, see for further examples]. The α6 subunit can form a functional receptor when co-expressed with β4 in vitro, but more efficient expression ensues from incorporation of a third partner, such as β3. The α7, α8, and α9 subunits form functional homo-oligomers, but can also combine with a second subunit to constitute a hetero-oligomeric assembly (e.g. α7β2 and α9α10). For functional expression of the α10 subunit, co-assembly with α9 is necessary. The latter, along with the α10 subunit, appears to be largely confined to cochlear and vestibular hair cells. Comprehensive listings of nicotinic receptor subunit combinations identified from recombinant expression systems, or in vivo, are given in. In addition, numerous proteins interact with nicotinic ACh receptors modifying their assembly, trafficking to and from the cell surface, and activation by ACh (reviewed by ).The nicotinic receptor Subcommittee of NC-IUPHAR has recommended a nomenclature and classification scheme for nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors based on the subunit composition of known, naturally- and/or heterologously-expressed nACh receptor subtypes. Headings for this table reflect abbreviations designating nACh receptor subtypes based on the predominant α subunit contained in that receptor subtype. An asterisk following the indicated α subunit denotes that other subunits are known to, or may, assemble with the indicated α subunit to form the designated nACh receptor subtype(s). Where subunit stoichiometries within a specific nACh receptor subtype are known, numbers of a particular subunit larger than 1 are indicated by a subscript following the subunit (enclosed in parentheses- see also ).",

The Nomenclature Subcommittee has recommended that for P2X receptors, structural criteria should be the initial basis for nomenclature where possible. X-ray crystallography indicates that functional P2X receptors are trimeric and three agonist molecules are required to bind to a single trimeric assembly in order to activate it. Native receptors may occur as either homotrimers (e.g. P2X1 in smooth muscle) or heterotrimers (e.g. P2X2:P2X3 in the nodose ganglion , P2X1:P2X5 in mouse cortical astrocytes , and P2X2:P2X5 in mouse dorsal root ganglion, spinal cord and mid pons. P2X2, P2X4 and P2X7 receptor activation can lead to influx of large cationic molecules, such as NMDG+, Yo-Pro, ethidium or propidium iodide. The permeability of the P2X7 receptor is modulated by the amount of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. The hemi-channel pannexin-1 was initially implicated in the action of P2X7 , but not P2X2, receptors , but this interpretation is probably misleading. Convincing evidence now supports the view that the activated P2X7 receptor is immediately permeable to large cationic molecules, but influx proceeds at a much slower pace than that of the small cations Na+, K+, and Ca2+.",

      "description": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs, nomenclature as agreed by NC-IUPHAR ) are members of a Na+ channel superfamily that includes the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), the FMRF-amide activated channel (FaNaC) of invertebrates, the degenerins (DEG) of Caenorhabitis elegans, channels in Drosophila melanogaster and 'orphan' channels that include BLINaC and INaC that have also been named BASICs, for bile acid-activated ion channels. ASIC subunits contain 2 TM domains and assemble as homo- or hetero-trimers to form proton-gated, voltage-insensitive, Na+ permeable, channels that are activated by levels of acidosis occurring in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions with ASIC3 also playing a role in mechanosensation (reviewed in ). Splice variants of ASIC1 [termed ASIC1a (ASIC, ASICα, BNaC2α) , ASIC1b (ASICβ, BNaC2β) and ASIC1b2 (ASICβ2) ; note that ASIC1a is also permeable to Ca2+], ASIC2 [termed ASIC2a (MDEG1, BNaC1α, BNC1α) and ASIC2b (MDEG2, BNaC1β) ] differ in the first third of the protein. Unlike ASIC2a (listed in table), heterologous expression of ASIC2b alone does not support H+-gated currents. A third member, ASIC3 (DRASIC, TNaC1) is one of the most pH-sensitive isoforms (along with ASIC1a) and has the fastest activation and desensitisation kinetics, however can also carry small sustained currents. ASIC4 (SPASIC) evolved as a proton-sensitive channel but seems to have lost this function in mammals. Mammalian ASIC4 does not support a proton-gated channel in heterologous expression systems but is reported to downregulate the expression of ASIC1a and ASIC3. ASICs channels are primarily expressed in central (ASIC1a, -2a, 2b and -4) and peripheral neurons including nociceptors (ASIC1-3) where they participate in neuronal sensitivity to acidosis. Humans express, in contrast to rodents, ASIC3 also in the brain. ASICs have also been detected in taste receptor cells (ASIC1-3)), photoreceptors and retinal cells (ASIC1-3), cochlear hair cells (ASIC1b), testis (hASIC3), pituitary gland (ASIC4), lung epithelial cells (ASIC1a and -3), urothelial cells, adipose cells (ASIC3), vascular smooth muscle cells (ASIC1-3), immune cells (ASIC1,-3 and -4) and bone (ASIC1-3) (ASIC distribution is reviewed in ). A neurotransmitter-like function of protons has been suggested, involving postsynaptically located ASICs of the CNS in functions such as learning and fear perception , responses to focal ischemia and to axonal degeneration in autoimmune inflammation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis , as well as seizures and pain. Heterologously expressed heteromultimers form ion channels with differences in kinetics, ion selectivity, pH- sensitivity and sensitivity to blockers that resemble some of the native proton activated currents recorded from neurones. In general, the known small molecule inhibitors of ASICs are non-selective or partially selective, whereas the venom peptide inhibitors have substantially higher selectivity and potency. Several clinically used drugs are known to inhibit ASICs, however they are generally more potent at other targets (e.g. amiloride at ENaCs, ibuprofen at COX enzymes). The information in the tables below are for the effects of inhibitors on homomeric channels, for information of known effects on heteromeric channels see the comments below.",

          "String": "Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)"
        }
      },
      "description": "OverviewThe epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the kidney tubules, lung, respiratory tract, male and female reproductive tracts, sweat and salivary glands, placenta, colon, and some other organs. In these epithelia, Na+ ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells via ENaC and are then pumped out of the cytoplasm into the interstitial fluid by the Na+/K+ ATPase located on the basolateral membrane. As Na+ is one of the major electrolytes in the extracellular fluid (ECF), osmolarity change initiated by the Na+ flow is accompanied by a flow of water. Thus, ENaC has a central role in regulating ECF volume and blood pressure, primarily via its function in the kidney. The expression of ENaC subunits, hence its activity, is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and other factors involved in electrolyte homeostasis. The genetics of the hereditary systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism type-I revealed that the activity of ENaC is dependent on three subunits encoded by three genes. Within the protein superfamily that includes ENaC, the crystal structure of ASIC was determined first, revealing a trimeric structure with a large extracellular domain anchored in the membrane with a bundle of six TM helices (two TM helices/subunit). The first 3D structure of human ENaC was determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.7 Å. A recent study improved the resolution to 3 Å. These structures confirmed that ENaC has a 3D quaternary structure similar to ASIC. ENaC is assembled as a hetero-trimer with a clockwise order of α-γ-β subunit viewed from the top, as shown previously. In contrast to ASIC1 which can assemble into a functional homotrimer, ENaC activity can be reconstituted fully only as a heterotrimer with an αβγ or a δβγ composition. In the respiratory tract and female reproductive tract, large segments of the epithelia are composed of multi-ciliated cells. In these cells, ENaC is located along the entire length of the cilia that cover the cell surface. Cilial location greatly increases ENaC density per cell surface and allows ENaC to serve as a sensitive regulator of osmolarity of the periciliary fluid throughout the whole depth of the fluid bathing the cilia. In contrast to ENaC, CFTR (ion transporter defective in cystic fibrosis) is located on the non-cilial cell surface. In the vas deferens segment of the male reproductive tract, the luminal surface is covered by microvilli and stereocilia projections with backbones composed of actin filament bundles. In these cells, both ENaC and the water channel aquaporin AQP9 are localized on these projections and also in the basal and smooth muscle layers. Thus, ENaC function regulates the volume of fluid lining epithelia essential for mucociliary clearance of respiratory airways, transport of germ cells, fertilization, implantation, and cell migration. Genes and PhylogenyIn the human genome, there are four homologous genes (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1D, and SCNN1G) that encode four proteins, α-, β-, γ-, and δ-ENaC that may be involved in the assembly of ENaC. These four subunits share 23-34% sequence identity and <20% identity with ASIC subunits. The genes coding for all four ENaC subunits are present in all bony vertebrates with the exception of ray-finned fish genomes that have lost all ENaC genes. The mouse genome has lost the gene SCNN1D that codes for δ-ENaC. The α-, β-, and γ-ENaC genes are also present in jawless vertebrates (e.g., lampreys) and cartilaginous fishes (e.g., sharks). Examination of the methylation patterns of the 5'-flanking region of SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes in human cells showed an inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation, suggesting epigenetic transcriptional control of ENaC genes. Channel biogenesis, assembly and functionThe expression of ENaC subunits is regulated primarily by aldosterone and many additional extracellular and intracellular factors. Most of the studies indicate that the expression of the three subunits is not coordinated. However, the transport of the subunits to the membrane is dependent on three intact subunits. Even a missense mutation in one subunit reduces the concentration of assembled channels on the cell surface. ENaC is a constitutively active channel, i.e., the flow of Na+ ions is not dependent on an activating factor. Hence, heterologous cells expressing ENaC (e.g., Xenopus oocytes), must be maintained in a solution that contains amiloride to keep ENaC inhibited. To measure ENaC activity, the bath solution is switched to a solution without amiloride. ENaC has two major states: 1) Open, and 2) Closed. The probability of ENaC being in the open state is called ENaC open probability (Po). ENaC activity is regulated by a diverse array of factors that exert their effects by modifying, directly or indirectly, two major parameters: 1) The density of ENaC in the membrane; and 2) The channel open probability. The Po of ENaC is greatly decreased by external Na+ and this response is called Na+ self-inhibition.An important aspect of ENaC regulation is that the α and the γ subunits have conserved serine protease cleavage sites in the extracellular segment. Cleavage of these subunits by proteases such as furin and plasmin leads to the activation of ENaC.Diseases associated with ENaC mutationsMutations in any of the three genes (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G) may cause partial or complete loss of ENaC activity, depending on the mutation. Such loss-of-function mutations are associated with a syndrome named \"systemic\" or \"multi-system\" autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1B). So far, no mutation has been found in the SCNN1D gene that causes PHA. PHA patients suffer from severe salt loss from all aldosterone target organs expressing ENaC, including kidney, sweat and salivary glands and respiratory tract. During infancy and early childhood, the severe electrolyte disturbances, dehydration and acidosis may require recurrent hospitalizations. The severity and frequency of salt-wasting episodes improve with age. PHA1B is also associated with a dysfunctional female reproductive system. The carboxy-terminal of ENaC includes a short consensus sequence called the PY motif. Mutations in this motif in SCNN1B and SCNN1G are associated with Liddle syndrome, which is characterized by early-onset hypertension. The PY motif is recognized by Nedd4-2 that is a ubiquitin ligase. Thus, mutations in the PY motif reduce ubiquitylation of ENaC leading to the accumulation of ENaC in the membrane, consequently enhance the activity of ENaC.ENaC expression in tumorsThe observation that [Na+] is higher in many cancerous cells as compared to non-cancerous cells has led to the suggestion that enhanced expression of ENaC may be responsible for increased metastasis. However, analysis of RNA sequencing data of ENaC-encoding genes, and clinical data of cervical cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed a negative correlation with histologic grades of tumor. Similarly, studies on breast cancer cells that altered α-ENaC levels by over-expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown showed that increased α-ENaC expression was associated with decreased breast cancer cell proliferation. In contrast, analysis of RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas showed that high expression of SCNN1A was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. These findings indicate that the association of ENaC levels with tumorigenesis varies depending on the tissue.COVID-19The surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions that cause COVID-19 is covered by many glycosylated S (spike) proteins. These S proteins bind to the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a first step in the entry of the virion into the host cell. Viral entry into the cell is dependent on the cleavage of the S protein (at Arg-667/Ser-668) by a serine-protease. Anand et al. showed that this cleavage site has a sequence motif that is homologous to the furin cleavage site in α-ENaC. A comprehensive review on the pathological consequences of COVID-19 suggests a role for ENaC in the early phases of COVID-19 infection in the respiratory tract epithelia.",

      "description": "Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins are membrane channels that allow the permeation of water and certain other small solutes across the cell membrane, or in the case of AQP6, AQP11 and AQP12A, intracellular membranes, such as vesicles and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Since the isolation and cloning of the first aquaporin (AQP1) , 12 additional mammalian members of the family have been identified, although little is known about the functional properties of one of these (AQP12A; Q8IXF9) and it is thus not tabulated. The other 12 aquaporins can be broadly divided into three families: orthodox aquaporins (AQP0,-1,-2,-4,-5, -6 and -8) permeable mainly to water, but for some additional solutes ; aquaglyceroporins (AQP3,-7 -9 and -10), additionally permeable to glycerol and for some isoforms urea , and superaquaporins (AQP11 and 12) located within cells. Some aquaporins also conduct ammonia and/or H2O2 giving rise to the terms 'ammoniaporins' ('aquaammoniaporins') and 'peroxiporins', respectively. Aquaporins are impermeable to protons and other inorganic and organic cations, with the possible exception of AQP1, although this is controversial. One or more members of this family of proteins have been found to be expressed in almost all tissues of the body [reviewed in Yang (2017) ]. AQPs are involved in numerous processes that include systemic water homeostasis, adipocyte metabolism, brain oedema, cell migration and fluid secretion by epithelia. Loss of function mutations of some human AQPs, or their disruption by autoantibodies further underscore their importance [reviewed by Verkman et al. (2014) , Kitchen et al. (2105) ]. Functional AQPs exist as homotetramers that are the water conducting units wherein individual AQP subunits (each a protomer) have six TM helices and two half helices that constitute a seventh 'pseudotransmembrane domain' that surrounds a narrow water conducting channel. In addition to the four pores contributed by the protomers, an additional hydrophobic pore exists within the center of the complex that may mediate the transport through AQP1. Although numerous small molecule inhibitors of aquaporins, particularly APQ1, have been reported primarily from Xenopus oocyte swelling assays, the activity of most has subsequently been disputed upon retesting using assays of water transport that are less prone to various artifacts and they are therefore excluded from the tables [see Tradtrantip et al. (2017) for a review].",

ClC-1 and ClC-2 are plasma membrane chloride channels. ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb are also plasma membrane channels (largely expressed in the kidney and inner ear) when associated with barttin (BSND, Q8WZ55), a 320 amino acid 2TM protein. The localisation of the remaining members of the ClC family is likely to be predominantly intracellular in vivo, although they may traffic to the plasma membrane in overexpression systems. Numerous recent reports indicate that ClC-4, ClC-5, ClC-6 and ClC-7 (and by inference ClC-3) function as Cl-/H+ antiporters (secondary active transport), rather than classical Cl- channels ; reviewed in ). It has recently been reported that the activity of ClC-5 as a Cl-/H+ exchanger is important for renal endocytosis. Alternative splicing increases the structural diversity within the ClC family. The crystal structure of two bacterial ClC proteins has been described and a eukaryotic ClC transporter (CmCLC) has recently been described at 3.5 Ã… resolution. Each ClC subunit, with a complex topology of 18 intramembrane segments, contributes a single pore to a dimeric â€˜double-barrelledâ€™ ClC channel that contains two independently gated pores, confirming the predictions of previous functional and structural investigations (reviewed in ). As found for ClC-4, ClC-5, ClC-6 and ClC-7, the prokaryotic ClC homologue (ClC-ec1) and CmCLC function as H+/Cl antiporters, rather than as ion channels. The generation of monomers from dimeric ClC-ec1 has firmly established that each ClC subunit is a functional unit for transport and that cross-subunit interaction is not required for Cl-/H+ exchange in ClC transporters.",

Of the 1700 mutations identified in CFTR, the most common is the deletion mutant ΔF508 (a class 2 mutation) which results in impaired trafficking of CFTR and reduces its incorporation into the plasma membrane causing cystic fibrosis (reviewed in ). Channels carrying the ΔF508 mutation that do traffic to the plasma membrane demonstrate gating defects. Thus, pharmacological restoration of the function of the ΔF508 mutant would require a compound that embodies 'corrector' (i.e. facilitates folding and trafficking to the cell surface) and 'potentiator' (i.e. promotes opening of channels at the cell surface) activities. In addition to acting as an anion channel per se, CFTR may act as a regulator of several other conductances including inhibition of the epithelial Na channel (ENaC), calcium activated chloride channels (CaCC) and volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), activation of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC), and enhancement of the sulphonylurea sensitivity of the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK2), (reviewed in ). CFTR also regulates TRPV4, which provides the Ca2+ signal for regulatory volume decrease in airway epithelia. The activities of CFTR and the chloride-bicarbonate exchangers SLC26A3 (DRA) and SLC26A6 (PAT1) are mutually enhanced by a physical association between the regulatory (R) domain of CFTR and the STAS domain of the SCL26 transporters, an effect facilitated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain of CFTR.",

      "description": "Chloride channels activated by intracellular calcium (CaCC) are widely expressed in excitable and non-excitable cells where they perform diverse functions. The molecular nature of CaCC has been uncertain with both CLCA, TWEETY and BEST genes having been considered as likely candidates. It is now accepted that CLCA expression products are unlikely to form channels per se and probably function as cell adhesion proteins, or are secreted. Similarly, TWEETY gene products do not recapictulate the properties of endogenous CaCC. The bestrophins encoded by genes BEST1-4 have a topology more consistent with ion channels and form chloride channels that are activated by physiological concentrations of Ca2+, but whether such activation is direct is not known. However, currents generated by bestrophin over-expression do not resemble native CaCC currents. The evidence for and against bestrophin proteins forming CaCC is critically reviewed by Duran et al.. Recently, a new gene family, TMEM16 (anoctamin) consisting of 10 members (TMEM16A-K; anoctamin 1-10) has been identified and there is firm evidence that some of these members form chloride channels. TMEM16A (anoctamin 1; Ano 1) produces Ca2+-activated Cl- currents with kinetics similar to native CaCC currents recorded from different cell types. Knockdown of TMEM16A greatly reduces currents mediated by calcium-activated chloride channels in submandibular gland cells and smooth muscle cells from pulmonary artery. In TMEM16A(-/-) mice secretion of Ca2+-dependent Cl- secretion by several epithelia is reduced. Alternative splicing regulates the voltage- and Ca2+- dependence of TMEM16A and such processing may be tissue-specific manner and thus contribute to functional diversity. There are also reports that TMEM16B (anoctamin 2; Ano 2) supports CaCC activity (e.g.) and in TMEM16B(-/-) mice Ca-activated Cl- currents in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and in the vomeronasal organ are virtually absent.",

Catterall, personal communication) is structurally a member of the family of voltage-gated sodium channel family (Nav1.1-Nav1.9). In contrast to the latter, NaVi2.1, is voltage-insensitive (denoted in the subscript 'vi' in the tentative nomenclature) and possesses distinctive ion selectivity and pharmacological properties. NaVi2.1, which is insensitive to tetrodotoxin (10 µM), has been proposed to mediate the tetrodotoxin-resistant and voltage-insensitive Na+ leak current (IL-Na) observed in many types of neurone. However, whether NaVi2.1 is constitutively active has been challenged. NaVi2.1 is widely distributed within the central nervous system and is also expressed in the heart and pancreas specifically, in rodents, within the islets of Langerhans. Recently, NaVi2.1 has been proposed to be a core effector for the action of inhibitory G proteins.",

      "description": "Enzymes are protein catalysts facilitating the conversion of substrates into products. The Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) classifies enzymes into families, using a four number code, on the basis of the reactions they catalyse. There are six main families:EC 1.-.-.- Oxidoreductases;EC 2.-.-.- Transferases;EC 3.-.-.- Hydrolases;EC 4.-.-.- Lyases; EC 5.-.-.- Isomerases;EC 6.-.-.- Ligases.Although there are many more enzymes than receptors in biology, and many drugs that target prokaryotic enzymes are effective medicines, overall the number of enzyme drug targets is relatively small , which is not to say that they are of modest importance.The majority of drugs which act on enzymes act as inhibitors; one exception is ingenol mebutate, which is a non-selective protein kinase C activator approved for the topical treatment of actinic keratoses. Kinetic assays allow discrimination of competitive, non-competitive, and un-competitive inhibitors. The majority of inhibitors are competitive (acting at the enzyme's ligand recognition site), non-competitive (acting at a distinct site; potentially interfering with co-factor or co-enzyme binding) or of mixed type. One rare example of an uncompetitive inhibitor is lithium ions, which are effective inhibitors at inositol monophosphatase only in the presence of high substrate concentrations. Some inhibitors are irreversible, including a group known as suicide substrates, which bind to the ligand recognition site and then couple covalently to the enzyme. It is beyond the scope of the Guide to give mechanistic information about the inhibitors described, although generally this information is available from the indicated literature.Many enzymes require additional entities for functional activity. Some of these are used in the catalytic steps, while others promote a particular conformational change. Co-factors are tightly bound to the enzyme and include metal ions and heme groups. Co-enzymes are typically small molecules which accept or donate functional groups to assist in the enzymatic reaction. Examples include ATP, NAD, NADP and S-adenosylmethionine, as well as a number of vitamins, such as riboflavin (vitamin B1) and thiamine (vitamin B2). Where co-factors/co-enzymes have been identified, the Guide indicates their involvement.",

L-Ornithine may be utilised as a precursor of polyamines (see Carboxylases and Decarboxylases) or recycled via L-argininosuccinic acid to L-arginine. L-Arginine may itself be decarboxylated to form agmatine, although the prominence of this pathway in human tissues is uncertain. L-Arginine may be used as a precursor for guanidoacetic acid formation in the creatine synthesis pathway under the influence of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase with L-ornithine as a byproduct. Nitric oxide synthase uses L-arginine to generate nitric oxide, with L-citrulline also as a byproduct.L-Arginine in proteins may be subject to post-translational modification through methylation, catalysed by protein arginine methyltransferases. Subsequent proteolysis can liberate asymmetric NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA), which is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase activities. ADMA is hydrolysed by dimethylarginine dimethylhydrolase activities to generate L-citrulline and dimethylamine.",

There are 3 NOS isoforms and they are related by their capacity to produce NO, highly conserved organization of functional domains and significant homology at the amino acid level. NOS isoforms are functionally distinguished by the cell type where they are expressed, intracellular targeting and transcriptional and post-translation mechanisms regulating enzyme activity. The nomenclature suggested by NC-IUPHAR of NOS I, II and III has not gained wide acceptance, and the 3 isoforms are more commonly referred to as neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) which reflect the location of expression (nNOS and eNOS) and inducible expression (iNOS). All are dimeric enzymes that shuttle electrons from NADPH, which binds to a C-terminal reductase domain, through the flavins FAD and FMN to the oxygenase domain of the other monomer to enable the BH4-dependent reduction of heme bound oxygen for insertion into the substrate, L-arginine. Electron flow from reductase to oxygenase domain is controlled by calmodulin binding to canonical calmodulin binding motif located between these domains. eNOS and nNOS isoforms are activated at concentrations of calcium greater than 100 nM, while iNOS shows higher affinity for Ca2+/calmodulin with great avidity and is essentially calcium-independent and constitutively active. Efficient stimulus-dependent coupling of nNOS and eNOS is achieved via subcellular targeting through respective N-terminal PDZ and fatty acid acylation domains whereas iNOS is largely cytosolic and function is independent of intracellular location. nNOS is primarily expressed in the brain and neuronal tissue, iNOS in immune cells such as macrophages and eNOS in the endothelial layer of the vasculature although exceptions in other cells have been documented. L-NAME and related modified arginine analogues are inhibitors of all three isoforms, with IC50 values in the micromolar range.",

Arachidonic acid is thought primarily to derive from phospholipase A2 action on membrane phosphatidylcholine, and may be re-cycled to form phospholipid through conjugation with coenzyme A and subsequently glycerol derivatives. Oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid is conducted through three major enzymatic routes: cyclooxygenases; lipoxygenases and cytochrome P450-like epoxygenases, particularly CYP2J2. Isoprostanes are structural analogues of the prostanoids (hence the nomenclature D-, E-, F-isoprostanes and isothromboxanes), which are produced in the presence of elevated free radicals in a non-enzymatic manner, leading to suggestions for their use as biomarkers of oxidative stress. Molecular targets for their action have yet to be defined.",

Conjugation of LTA4 at the 6 position with reduced glutathione to generate LTC4 occurs under the influence of leukotriene C4 synthase, with the subsequent formation of LTD4 and LTE4, all three of which are agonists at CysLT receptors. LTD4 formation is catalysed by γ-glutamyltransferase, and subsequently dipeptidase 2 removes the terminal glycine from LTD4 to generate LTE4. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase converts the 5,6-epoxide LTA4 to the 5-hydroxylated LTB4, an agonist for BLT receptors. LTA4 is also acted upon by 12S-LOX to produce the trihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids lipoxins LXA4 and LXB4. Treatment with a LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor in a murine model of allergic airway inflammation increased LXA4 levels, in addition to reducing LTB4, in lung lavage fluid. LTA4 hydrolase is also involved in biosynthesis of resolvin Es. aspirin has been reported to increase endogenous formation of 18S-hydroxyeicosapentaenoate compared with 18R-HEPE, a resolvin precursor. Both enantiomers may be metabolised by human recombinant 5-LOX; recombinant LTA4 hydrolase converted chiral 5S(6)-epoxide-containing intermediates to resolvin E1 and 18S-resolvin E1.",

PLC-ε1 may represent a point of convergence of signalling via both G protein-coupled and catalytic receptors. Ca2+ ions are required for catalytic activity of PLC isoforms and have been suggested to be the major physiological form of regulation of PLC-δ activity.

There is evidence that PI3K can also phosphorylate serine/threonine residues on proteins. In addition to the classes described below, further serine/threonine protein kinases, including ATM (Q13315) and mTOR (P42345), have been described to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and have been termed PI3K-related kinases. Structurally, PI3Ks have common motifs of at least one C2, calcium-binding domain and helical domains, alongside structurally-conserved catalytic domains. wortmannin and LY 294002 are widely-used inhibitors of PI3K activities. wortmannin is irreversible and shows modest selectivity between Class I and Class II PI3K, while LY294002 is reversible and selective for Class I compared to Class II PI3K.Class I PI3Ks (EC 2.7.1.153) phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and are heterodimeric, matching catalytic and regulatory subunits. Class IA PI3Ks include p110α, p110β and p110δ catalytic subunits, with predominantly p85 and p55 regulatory subunits. The single catalytic subunit that forms Class IB PI3K is p110γ. Class IA PI3Ks are more associated with receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, while the Class IB PI3K is linked more with GPCR signalling.Class II PI3Ks (EC 2.7.1.154) phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (and possibly phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate). Three monomeric members exist, PI3K-C2α, β and β, and include Ras-binding, Phox homology and two C2 domains.The only class III PI3K isoform (EC 2.7.1.137) is a heterodimer formed of a catalytic subunit (VPS34) and regulatory subunit (VPS15).Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinasesPhosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (EC 2.7.1.67) generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and may be divided into higher molecular weight type III and lower molecular weight type II forms.",

The phosphorylated receptor binds, with high affinity, a member of the arrestin family (ENSFM00250000000572), which prevents further signalling through the G protein (uncoupling) and may allow interaction with scaffolding proteins, such as clathrin, with the possible consequence of internalization and/or degradation.",

Many commonly used chemotherapy drugs cause the type of DNA damage that induces activation of ATR. By preventing DNA repair in cancer cells (which are under replication stress and suffer from increased DNA damage and defective DNA damage repair), inhibition of ATR is expected to drive the cancer cells towards cell cycle arrest and cell death , particularly if used in combination with DNA damaging drugs. Several ATR inhibitors are in active clinical development pipelines.",

JNKs belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and share the family sensitivity to stress stimuli. JNK pathway activation has positive and negative regulatory effects on downstream proteins. c-Jun, ATF2, ELK1, SMAD4, p53 and HSF1 are amongst the targets that are activated by JNK activity, whereas NFAT4, NFATC1 and STAT3 are inhibited by JNK activity. JNKs contribute to cellular differentiation and apoptosis, and to the inflammatory response.",

Inhibition of these enzymes reduces inflammatory cytokine synthesis. p38 MAP kinase enzymes are therefore highly pursued drug targets for conditions including inflammation, arthritis and other joint diseases, septic shock, and myocardial injury.",

There are splice variants of each isoform (SphK1a-c and SphK2a, b), distinguished by their N-terminal sequences. SPHK1 and SPHK2 differ in tissue distribution, sub-cellular localisation, biochemical properties and regulation. They regulate discrete pools of S1P. Receptor stimulation induces SPHK1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. SPHK1 translocation is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, specific protein:protein interactions and interaction with specific lipids at the plasma membrane. SPHK1 is a dimeric protein, as confirmed by its crystal structure which forms a positive cluster, between protomers, essential for interaction with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. SPHK2 is localised to the ER or associated with mitochondria or shuttles in/out of the nucleus, regulated by phosphorylation. Intracellular targets of nuclear S1P include the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) and regulators of gene expression including histone deacetylases (HDAC 1/2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). SPHK2 phosphorylates the pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, which is used to treat some forms of multiple sclerosis) to a mimic of S1P and that acts as a functional antagonist of S1P1 receptors. Inhibitors of SPHK1 and SPHK2 have therapeutic potential in many diseases. Isoform-selective inhibitors are becoming available; some early inhibitors have recognised off-target effects.",

These are evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinases, sharing a high degree of sequence homology, but with quite different subcellular distributions and functions. Aurora kinases A and B are widely expressed in dividing cells, whereas Aurora kinase C expression appears to be restricted to the testes. Their importance in the mitotic cycle has driven the development of Aurora kinase inhibitors as therapeutic antimitotic agents for both adult and childhood malignancies.",

A set of rare autoimmune disorders known as type I interferonopathies are caused by disturbance of the homeostatic control of induction, transmission, and resolution of the type I IFN-mediated immune response. Therefore, members of this signaling pathway are subject to investigation as intervention points for pharmacological inhibition. Initial investigations targeted IFN-I downstream signaling, including IFN-I proteins, IFNAR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. For example, sifalimumab (anti-IFN-α mAb), anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR1) and the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, can all potentially tackle the effector function of dysregulated IFN by blocking downstream IFN-I signaling, but do not contribute to reducing the production of IFN. Upstream targeting of TBK1 and/or IKKε could be effective at blocking de novo IFN-I induction by a variety of stimuli. Small molecule kinase inhibitors of TBK1/IKKε already in development for cancer may expedite investigation for inflammatory diseases also.",

In the human genome, 58 RTKs have been identified, which fall into 20 families. All RTKs display an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a cytoplasmic region containing the protein tyrosine kinase activity (occasionally split into two domains by an insertion, termed the kinase insertion), with juxta-membrane and C-terminal regulatory regions. Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-γ, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.  RTKs are of widespread interest not only through physiological functions, but also as drug targets in many types of cancer and other disease states. Many diseases result from genetic changes or abnormalities that either alter the activity, abundance, cellular distribution and/or regulation of RTKs. Therefore, drugs that modify the dysregulated functions of these RTKs have been developed which fall into two categories. One group is often described as â€˜biologicalsâ€™, which block the activation of RTKs directly or by chelating the cognate ligands, while the second are small molecules designed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity directly.",

Exceptionally amongst the catalytic receptors, the functional receptor in the insulin receptor family is derived from a single gene product, cleaved post-translationally into two peptides, which then cross-link via disulphide bridges to form a heterotetramer. Intriguingly, the endogenous peptide ligands are formed in a parallel fashion with post-translational processing producing a heterodimer linked by disulphide bridges. Signalling through the receptors is mediated through a rapid autophosphorylation event at intracellular tyrosine residues, followed by recruitment of multiple adaptor proteins, notably IRS1 (P35568), IRS2 (Q9Y4H2), SHC1 (P29353), GRB2 (P62993) and SOS1 (Q07889).Serum levels of free IGFs are kept low by the action of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1-5, P08833, P18065, P17936, P22692, P24593), which sequester the IGFs; overexpression of IGFBPs may induce apoptosis, while IGFBP levels are also altered in some cancers.",

      "description": "Receptor serine/threonine kinases (RSTK), EC 2.7.11.30, respond to particular cytokines, the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families, and may be divided into two subfamilies on the basis of structural similarities. Agonist binding initiates formation of a cell-surface complex of type I and type II RSTK, possibly heterotetrameric, where both subunits express serine/threonine kinase activity. The type I receptor serine/threonine kinases are also known as activin receptors or activin receptor-like kinases, ALKs, for which a systematic nomenclature has been proposed (ALK1-7). The type II protein phosphorylates the kinase domain of the type I partner (sometimes referred to as the signal propagating subunit), causing displacement of the protein partners, such as the FKBP12 FK506-binding protein FKBP1A (P62942) and allowing the binding and phosphorylation of particular members of the Smad family. These migrate to the nucleus and act as complexes to regulate gene transcription. Type III receptors, sometimes called co-receptors or accessory proteins, regulate the signalling of the receptor complex, in either enhancing (for example, presenting the ligand to the receptor) or inhibitory manners. TGFβ family ligand signalling may be inhibited by endogenous proteins, such as follistatin, which binds and neutralizes activins to prevent activation of the target receptors.Endogenous agonists, approximately 30 in man, are often described as paracrine messengers acting close to the source of production. They are characterized by six conserved cysteine residues and are divided into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence comparison and signalling pathways activated, the TGFβ/activin/nodal subfamily and the BMP/GDF (growth/differentiation factor)/MIS (Müllerian inhibiting substance) subfamily. Ligands active at RSTKs appear to be generated as large precursors which undergo complex maturation processes. Some are known to form disulphide-linked homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes. Thus, inhibins are α subunits linked to a variety of β chains, while activins are combinations of β subunits.",

Caspases are heterotetrameric, being made up of two pairs of subunits, generated by a single gene product, which is proteolysed to form the mature protein. Members of the mammalian inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) are able to bind the procaspases, thereby preventing maturation to active proteinases.",

As liver PCSK9 acts to maintain cholesterol homeostasis, it has become a target of intense interest for clinical drug development. Inhibition of PCSK9 can lower low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) by clearing LDLR-bound LDL particles, thereby lowering circulating cholesterol levels. It is hypothesised that this action may improve outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Therapeutics which inhibit PCSK9 are viewed as potentially lucrative replacements for statins, upon statin patent expiry. Several monoclonal antibodies including alirocumab, evolocumab, bococizumab, RG-7652 and LY3015014 are under development. One RNAi therapeutic, code named ALN-PCS02, is also in development.",

The coagulation cascade involves multiple proteins being converted to more active forms from less active precursors (for example, prothrombin [Factor II] is converted to thrombin [Factor IIa]), typically through proteolysis (see Proteases).

GAD1 and GAD2 are differentially expressed during development, where GAD2 is thought to subserve a trophic role in early life and is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. GAD1 is expressed in later life and is more associated with nerve terminals where GABA is principally accumulated in vesicles through the action of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter SLC32A1. The role of γ-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH9A1) in neurotransmitter GABA synthesis is less clear. Following release from neurons, GABA may interact with either GABAA or GABAB receptors and may be accumulated in neurones and glia through the action of members of the SLC6 family of transporters. Successive metabolism through GABA transaminase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase generates succinic acid, which may be further metabolized in the mitochondria in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.",

In the somatic nervous system, it activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. It is also employed in the autonomic nervous system, in both parasympathetic and sympathetic branches; in the former, at the smooth muscle neuromuscular junction, activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In the latter, acetylcholine is involved as a neurotransmitter at the ganglion, activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Acetylcholine is synthesised in neurones through the action of choline O-acetyltransferase and metabolised after release through the extracellular action of acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase. Choline is accumulated from the extracellular medium by selective transporters (see SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family). Acetylcholine is accumulated in synaptic vesicles through the action of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter SLC18A3.",

The predominant catacholamines in mammalian biology are the neurotransmitter/hormones dopamine, (-)-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and (-)-adrenaline (epinephrine). These hormone/transmitters are synthesized by sequential metabolism from L-phenylalanine via L-tyrosine. Hydroxylation of L-tyrosine generates levodopa, which is decarboxylated to form dopamine. Hydroxylation of the ethylamine sidechain generates (-)-noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which can be methylated to form (-)-adrenaline (epinephrine). In particular neuronal and adrenal chromaffin cells, the catecholamines dopamine, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline are accumulated into vesicles under the influence of the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT1/SLC18A1 and VMAT2/SLC18A2). After release into the synapse or the bloodstream, catecholamines are accumulated through the action cell-surface transporters, primarily the dopamine (DAT/SLC6A3) and norepinephrine transporter (NET/SLC6A2). The primary routes of metabolism of these catecholamines are oxidation via monoamine oxidase activities of methylation via catechol O-methyltransferase.",

N-Acylation allows the formation of dihydroceramides, which are subsequently reduced to form ceramides. Once synthesized, ceramides are trafficked from the ER to the Golgi bound to the ceramide transfer protein, CERT (COL4A3BP, Q9Y5P4). Ceramide can be metabolized via multiple routes, ensuring tight regulation of its cellular levels. Addition of phosphocholine generates sphingomyelin while carbohydrate is added to form glucosyl- or galactosylceramides. Ceramidase re-forms sphingosine or sphinganine from ceramide or dihydroceramide. Phosphorylation of ceramide generates ceramide phosphate. The determination of accurate kinetic parameters for many of the enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway is complicated by the lipophilic nature of the substrates.",

It can be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3) or cleaved into phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (EC 4.1.2.27). Recessive mutations in the S1P lyase (SPL) gene underlie a recently identified sphingolipidosis: SPL Insufficiency Syndrome (SPLIS). In general, S1P promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis. Intracellular S1P affects epigenetic regulation, endosomal processing, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation/senescence. S1P has myriad physiological functions, including vascular development, lymphocyte trafficking and neurogenesis. However, S1P is also involved in a number of diseases such as cancer, inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, its GPCRs and enzymes of synthesis and degradation are a major focus for drug discovery.",

There are splice variants of each isoform (SphK1a-c and SphK2a, b), distinguished by their N-terminal sequences. SPHK1 and SPHK2 differ in tissue distribution, sub-cellular localisation, biochemical properties and regulation. They regulate discrete pools of S1P. Receptor stimulation induces SPHK1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. SPHK1 translocation is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, specific protein:protein interactions and interaction with specific lipids at the plasma membrane. SPHK1 is a dimeric protein, as confirmed by its crystal structure which forms a positive cluster, between protomers, essential for interaction with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. SPHK2 is localised to the ER or associated with mitochondria or shuttles in/out of the nucleus, regulated by phosphorylation. Intracellular targets of nuclear S1P include the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) and regulators of gene expression including histone deacetylases (HDAC 1/2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). SPHK2 phosphorylates the pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, which is used to treat some forms of multiple sclerosis) to a mimic of S1P and that acts as a functional antagonist of S1P1 receptors. Inhibitors of SPHK1 and SPHK2 have therapeutic potential in many diseases. Isoform-selective inhibitors are becoming available; some early inhibitors have recognised off-target effects.",

      "description": "Chromatin modifying enzymes, and other chromatin-modifying proteins, fall into three broad categories: writers, readers and erasers. The function of these proteins is to dynamically maintain cell identity and regulate processes such as differentiation, development, proliferation and genome integrity via recognition of specific 'marks' (covalent post-translational modifications) on histone proteins and DNA. In normal cells, tissues and organs, precise co-ordination of these proteins ensures expression of only those genes required to specify phenotype or which are required at specific times, for specific functions. Chromatin modifications allow DNA modifications not coded by the DNA sequence to be passed on through the genome and underlies heritable phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation, aging, heterochromatin formation, reprogramming, and gene silencing (epigenetic control). To date at least eight distinct types of modifications are found on histones. These include small covalent modifications such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, the attachment of larger modifiers such as ubiquitination or sumoylation, and ADP ribosylation, proline isomerization and deimination. Chromatin modifications and the functions they regulate in cells are reviewed by Kouzarides (2007). Writer proteins include the histone methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases, some kinases and ubiquitin ligases.Readers include proteins which contain methyl-lysine-recognition motifs such as bromodomains, chromodomains, tudor domains, PHD zinc fingers, PWWP domains and MBT domains.Erasers include the histone demethylases and histone deacetylases (HDACs and sirtuins).Dysregulated epigenetic control can be associated with human diseases such as cancer , where a wide variety of cellular and protein abberations are known to perturb chromatin structure, gene transcription and ultimately cellular pathways. Due to the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, chromatin regulators are very tractable targets for drug discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of writers (e.g. azacitidine and decitabine target the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3 for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes ) and erasers (e.g. the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat, romidepsin and belinostat for the treatment of T-cell lymphomas ) are already being used in the clinic. The search for the next generation of compounds with improved specificity against chromatin-associated proteins is an area of intense basic and clinical research. Current progress in this field is reviewed by Simó-Riudalbas and Esteller (2015).",

The glycerol esters and ethanolamides are synthesised and hydrolysed by parallel, independent pathways. Mechanisms for release and re-uptake of endocannabinoids are unclear, although potent and selective inhibitors of facilitated diffusion of endocannabinoids across cell membranes have been developed. FABP5 (Q01469) has been suggested to act as a canonical intracellular endocannabinoid transporter in vivo. For the generation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, the key enzyme involved is diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), whilst several routes for anandamide synthesis have been described, the best characterized of which involves N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD, ). A transacylation enzyme which forms N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines has been identified as a cytosolic enzyme, PLA2G4E (Q3MJ16).  In vitro experiments indicate that the endocannabinoids are also substrates for oxidative metabolism via cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 enzyme activities.",

Ubiquitination of proteins can target them for proteasomal degradation, or modulate cellular processes including cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and signal transduction. E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which there are >600 in humans, are a family of highly heterogeneous proteins and protein complexes that recruit ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes to mediate transfer of the ubiquitin molecule from the E2 to protein substrates. Target substrate specificity is determined by a substrate recognition subunit within the E3 complex. E3 ligases are being exploited as pharmacological targets to facilitate targeted protein degradation (TPD), as an alternative to small molecule inhibitors , through the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues.",

A third source of citrate is that produced intracellularly by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) from α-ketoglutarate (arising from glutamine metabolism) under conditions of hypoxic stress for example. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) converts cytosolic citrate into acetyl-CoA which is then utilised for lipogenesis. Targeting citrate transport and/or synthesis are mechanisms being explored for lipid-lowering potential and application to the treatment of chronic metabolic diseases that are characterised by dysregulated lipogenesis. Inhibition of IDH activity has been directed towards anti-tumour drug development, with two IDH inhibitors already in clinical use.",

      "description": "The majority of biological solutes are charged organic or inorganic molecules. Cellular membranes are hydrophobic and, therefore, effective barriers to separate them allowing the formation of gradients, which can be exploited, for example, in the generation of energy. Membrane transporters carry solutes across cell membranes, which would otherwise be impermeable to them. The energy required for active transport processes is obtained from ATP turnover or by exploiting ion gradients. ATP-driven transporters can be divided into three major classes: P-type ATPases; F-type or V-type ATPases and ATP-binding cassette transporters. The first of these, P-type ATPases, are multimeric proteins, which transport (primarily) inorganic cations. The second, F-type or V-type ATPases, are proton-coupled motors, which can function either as transporters or as motors. Last, are ATP-binding cassette transporters, heavily involved in drug disposition as well as transporting endogenous solutes.The second largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome, after the G protein-coupled receptors, are the SLC solute carrier family. Within the solute carrier family, there are a great variety of solutes transported, from simple inorganic ions to amino acids and sugars to relatively complex organic molecules like haem. The solute carrier family includes 65 families of almost 400 members. Many of these overlap in terms of the solutes that they carry. For example, amino acids accumulation is mediated by members of the SLC1, SLC3/7, SLC6, SLC15, SLC16, SLC17, SLC32, SLC36, SLC38 and SLC43 families. Further members of the SLC superfamily regulate ion fluxes at the plasma membrane, or solute transport into and out of cellular organelles. Some SLC family members remain orphan transporters, in as much as a physiological function has yet to be dtermined. Within the SLC superfamily, there is an abundance in diversity of structure. Two families (SLC3 and SLC7) only generate functional transporters as heteromeric partners, where one partner is a single TM domain protein. Membrane topology predictions for other families suggest 3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 or 14 TM domains. The SLC transporters include members which function as antiports, where solute movement in one direction is balanced by a solute moving in the reverse direction. Symports allow concentration gradients of one solute to allow co-transport of a second solute across a membrane. A third, relatively small group are equilibrative transporters, which allow solutes to travel across membranes down their concentration gradients. A more complex family of transporters, the SLC27 fatty acid transporters also exhibit enzymatic function. Many of the transporters also manifest electrogenic properties of ion channels.",

The active transporter is a heteromultimer with incompletely defined stoichiometry, possibly as tetramers of heterodimers, each consisting of one of four large, ten TM domain catalytic α subunits and one of three smaller, single TM domain glycoprotein β-subunits (see table). Additional protein partners known as FXYD proteins (e.g. FXYD2, P54710) appear to associate with and regulate the activity of the pump.",

      "description": "The SLC superfamily of solute carriers is the second largest family of membrane proteins after G protein-coupled receptors, but with a great deal fewer therapeutic drugs that exploit them. As with the ABC transporters, however, they play a major role in drug disposition and so can be hugely influential in determining the clinical efficacy of particular drugs. 48 families are identified on the basis of sequence similarities, but many of them overlap in terms of the solutes that they carry. For example, amino acid accumulation is mediated by members of the SLC1, SLC3/7, SLC6, SLC15, SLC16, SLC17, SLC32, SLC36, SLC38 and SLC43. Further members of the SLC superfamily regulate ion fluxes at the plasma membrane, or solute transport into and out of cellular organelles.Within the SLC superfamily, there is an abundance in diversity of structure. Two families (SLC3 and SLC7) only generate functional transporters as heteromeric partners, where one partner is a single TM domain protein. Membrane topology predictions for other families suggest 3, 4 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 TM domains. Functionally, members may be divided into those dependent on gradients of ions (particularly sodium, chloride or protons), exchange of solutes or simple equilibrative gating. For many members, the stoichiometry of transport is not yet established. Furthermore, one family of transporters also possess enzymatic activity (SLC27), while many members function as ion channels (e.g. SLC1A7/EAAT5), which increases the complexity of function of the SLC superfamily.",

      "description": "Glutamate transporters present the unusual structural motif of 8TM segments and 2 re-entrant loops. The crystal structure of a glutamate transporter homologue (GltPh) from Pyrococcus horikoshii supports this topology and indicates that the transporter assembles as a trimer, where each monomer is a functional unit capable of substrate permeation reviewed by ). This structural data is in agreement with the proposed quaternary structure for EAAT2 and several functional studies that propose the monomer is the functional unit. Recent evidence suggests that EAAT3 and EAAT4 may assemble as heterotrimers. The activity of glutamate transporters located upon both neurones (predominantly EAAT3, 4 and 5) and glia (predominantly EAAT 1 and 2) serves, dependent upon their location, to regulate excitatory neurotransmission, maintain low ambient extracellular concentrations of glutamate (protecting against excitotoxicity) and provide glutamate for metabolism including the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The Na+/K+-ATPase that maintains the ion gradients that drive transport has been demonstrated to co-assemble with EAAT1 and EAAT2. Recent evidence supports altered glutamate transport and novel roles in brain for splice variants of EAAT1 and EAAT2. Three patients with dicarboxylic aminoaciduria (DA) were recently found to have loss-of-function mutations in EAAT3. DA is characterized by excessive excretion of the acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate and EAAT3 is the predominant glutamate/aspartate transporter in the kidney. Enhanced expression of EAAT2 resulting from administration of β-lactam antibacterials (e.g. ceftriaxone) is neuroprotective and occurs through NF-κB-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation reviewed by ). PPARγ activation (e.g. by rosiglitazone) also leads to enhanced expression of EAAT though promoter activation. In addition, several translational activators of EAAT2 have recently been described along with treatments that increase the surface expression of EAAT2 (e.g. ), or prevent its down-regulation (e.g. ). A thermodynamically uncoupled Cl- flux, activated by Na+ and glutamate (Na+ and aspartate in the case of GltPh ), is sufficiently large, in the instances of EAAT4 and EAAT5, to influence neuronal excitability. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that the primary function of EAAT5 is as a slow anion channel gated by glutamate, rather than a glutamate transporter.",

Through recapture of choline generated by the hydrolysis of ACh by acetylcholinesterase, CHT serves to maintain acetylcholine synthesis within the presynaptic terminal. Homozygous mice engineered to lack CHT die within one hour of birth as a result of hypoxia arising from failure of transmission at the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscles that support respiration.

      "description": "The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is an iodide transporter found principally in the thyroid gland where it mediates the accumulation of I- within thyrocytes. Transport of I- by NIS from the blood across the basolateral membrane followed by apical efflux into the colloidal lumen, mediated at least in part by pendrin (SLC22A4), and most likely not SMCT1 (SLC5A8) as once thought, provides the I- required for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine. NIS is also expressed in the salivary glands, gastric mucosa, intestinal enterocytes and lactating breast. NIS mediates I- absorption in the intestine and I- secretion into the milk. SMVT is expressed on the apical membrane of intestinal enterocytes and colonocytes and is the main system responsible for biotin (vitamin H) and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) uptake in humans. SMVT located in kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells mediates the reabsorption of biotin and pantothenic acid. SMCT1 (SLC5A8), which transports a wide range of monocarboxylates, is expressed in the apical membrane of epithelia of the small intestine, colon, kidney, brain neurones and the retinal pigment epithelium. SMCT2 (SLC5A12) also localises to the apical membrane of kidney, intestine, and colon, but in the brain and retina is restricted to astrocytes and MÃ¼ller cells, respectively. SMCT1 is a high-affinity transporter whereas SMCT2 is a low-affinity transporter. The physiological substrates for SMCT1 and SMCT2 are lactate (L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid), pyruvic acid, propanoic acid, and nicotinic acid in non-colonic tissues such as the kidney. SMCT1 is also likely to be the principal transporter for the absorption of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) in the intestine and kidney. In the small intestine and colon, the physiological substrates for these transporters are nicotinic acid and the short-chain fatty acids acetic acid, propanoic acid, and butyric acid that are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber. In the kidney, SMCT2 is responsible for the bulk absorption of lactate because of its low-affinity/high-capacity nature. Absence of both transporters in the kidney leads to massive excretion of lactate in urine and consequently drastic decrease in the circulating levels of lactate in blood. SMCT1 also functions as a tumour suppressor in the colon as well as in various other non-colonic tissues. The tumour-suppressive function of SMCT1 is based on its ability to transport pyruvic acid, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, into cells in non-colonic tissues ; in the colon, the ability of SMCT1 to transport butyric acid and propanoic acid, also inhibitors of histone deacetylases, underlies the tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. The ability of SMCT1 to promote histone acetylase inhibition through accumulation of butyric acid and propanoic acid in immune cells is also responsible for suppression of dendritic cell development in the colon.",

      "description": "The activity of GABA-transporters located predominantly upon neurones (GAT-1), glia (GAT-3) or both (GAT-2, BGT-1) serves to terminate phasic GABA-ergic transmission, maintain low ambient extracellular concentrations of GABA, and recycle GABA for reuse by neurones. Nonetheless, ambient concentrations of GABA are sufficient to sustain tonic inhibition mediated by high affinity GABAA receptors in certain neuronal populations. GAT1 is the predominant GABA transporter in the brain and occurs primarily upon the terminals of presynaptic neurones and to a much lesser extent upon distal astocytic processes that are in proximity to axons terminals. GAT3 resides predominantly on distal astrocytic terminals that are close to the GABAergic synapse. By contrast, BGT1 occupies an extrasynaptic location possibly along with GAT2 which has limited expression in the brain. TauT is a high affinity taurine transporter involved in osmotic balance that occurs in the brain and non-neuronal tissues, such as the kidney, brush border membrane of the intestine and blood brain barrier. CT1, which transports creatine, has a ubiquitous expression pattern, often co-localizing with creatine kinase.",

      "description": "Two gene products, GlyT1 and GlyT2, are known that give rise to transporters that are predominantly located on glia and neurones, respectively. Five variants of GlyT1 (a,b,c,d & e) differing in their N- and C-termini are generated by alternative promoter usage and splicing, and three splice variants of GlyT2 (a,b & c) have also been identified (see for reviews). GlyT1 transporter isoforms expressed in glia surrounding glutamatergic synapses regulate synaptic glycine concentrations influencing NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission , but also are important, in early neonatal life, for regulating glycine concentrations at inhibitory glycinergic synapses. Homozygous mice engineered to totally lack GlyT1 exhibit severe respiratory and motor deficiencies due to hyperactive glycinergic signalling and die within the first postnatal day. Disruption of GlyT1 restricted to forebrain neurones is associated with enhancement of EPSCs mediated by NMDA receptors and behaviours that are suggestive of a promnesic action. GlyT2 transporters localised on the axons and boutons of glycinergic neurones appear crucial for efficient transmitter loading of synaptic vesicles but may not be essential for the termination of inhibitory neurotransmission. Mice in which GlyT2 has been deleted develop a fatal hyperekplexia phenotype during the second postnatal week and mutations in the human gene encoding GlyT2 (SLC6A5) have been identified in patients with hyperekplexia (reviewed by ). ATB0+ (SLC6A14) is a transporter for numerous dipolar and cationic amino acids and thus has a much broader substrate specificity than the glycine transporters alongside which it is grouped on the basis of structural similarity. ATB0+ is expressed in various peripheral tissues. By contrast PROT (SLC6A7), which is expressed only in brain in association with a subset of excitatory nerve terminals, shows specificity for the transport of L-proline.",

Several isoforms, NHE6, NHE7, NHE8 and NHE9 appear to locate on intracellular membranes. Li+ and NH4+, but not K+, ions may also be transported by some isoforms. Modelling of the topology of these transporters indicates 12 TM regions with an extended intracellular C-terminus containing multiple regulatory sites.NHE1 is considered to be a ubiquitously-expressed â€˜housekeepingâ€™ transporter. NHE3 is highly expressed in the intestine and kidneys and regulate sodium movements in those tissues. NHE10 is present in sperm and osteoclasts ; gene disruption results in infertile male mice.",

Both proteins appear to have 12 TM regions and cytoplasmic N- and C- termini. NRAMP1 is involved in antimicrobial action in macrophages, although its precise mechanism is undefined. Facilitated diffusion of divalent cations into phagosomes may increase intravesicular free radicals to damage the pathogen. Alternatively, export of divalent cations from the phagosome may deprive the pathogen of essential enzyme cofactors.

However, an alternative 9TM structure with the N terminus facing the cytoplasm and the C terminus residing in the synaptic vesicle lumen has subsequently been reported. VIAAT acts as an antiporter for inhibitory amino acids and protons. The accumulation of GABA and glycine within vesicles is driven by both the chemical (ΔpH) and electrical (Δψ) components of the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔµH+) established by a vacuolar H+-ATPase. However, one study, , presented evidence that VIAAT is instead a Cl-/GABA co-transporter. VIAAT co-exists with VGLUT1 (SLC17A7), or VGLUT2 (SLC17A6), in the synaptic vesicles of selected nerve terminals. VIAAT knock out mice die between embryonic day 18.5 and birth.

These glycoprotein antigens derive from two genes, RHCE (P18577) and RHD (Q02161), expressed on the surface of erythrocytes. On erythrocytes, RhAG associates with these antigens and functions as an ammonium transporter. RhBG and RhBG are non-erythroid related sequences associated with epithelia. Topological modelling suggests the presence of 12TM with cytoplasmic N- and C- termini. The majority of information on these transporters derives from orthologues in yeast, plants and bacteria. More recent evidence points to family members being permeable to carbon dioxide, leading to the term gas channels.",

CLT1 is expressed almost ubiquitously in human tissues and mediates choline transport across the plasma and mitochondrial membranes. Transport of choline by CTL2, which in rodents is expressed as two isoforms (CTL2P1 and CLTP2; ) in lung, colon, inner ear and spleen and to a lesser extent in brain, tongue, liver, and kidney, has only recently been demonstrated.

FLVCR-mediated heme transport is essential for erythropoiesis. Flvcr1 gene mutations have been identified as the cause of PCARP (posterior column ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP).There are three paralogs of FLVCR1 in the human genome.FLVCR2, most similar to FLVCR1 , has been reported to function as a heme importer , although biochemical and molecular evidence to support this function is elusive. In addition, a congenital syndrome of proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly, also known as Fowler's syndrome, is associated with a loss-of-function mutation in FLVCR2.FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 have been shown to mediate choline and ethanolamine influx into cells.

RGS proteins stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis on GÎ± and thus induce a conformational change in the GÎ± subunit that accelerates GTP hydrolysis, thereby effectively turning off signaling cascades mediated by GPCRs. This GTPase accelerating protein (GAP) activity is the canonical mechanism of action for RGS proteins, although many also possess additional functions and domains.

The family is structurally subdivided into three distinct groups based on the presence of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1-4).1: Proapoptotic BH3-only subgroup; Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, Hrk, Bmf, Noxa, Puma and bNIP32: Proapoptotic 'effectors'; Bak, Bok and Bax3: Antiapoptotic subgroup; Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and Bcl2-A1.Binding between pro- and anti-apoptotic members via BH domains dictates the death or survival of cells. The BH3-only subgroup members initiate apoptosis in response to cellular damage. In response to these same signals the proapoptotic subgroup containing BH1-3 (Bax and Bak) oligomerize on the mitochondrial membrane, acting to increase mitochondrial membrane permeability to apoptogenic factors (such as cytochrome C) stored in the mitochondrial lumen. When released, these factors activate cell-killing caspases. The antiapoptotic members contain all four BH domains and protect cells from apoptosis by directly binding to and sequestering their proapoptotic counterparts via BH3 interactions.Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is associated with various cancers in which the normal apoptotic pathway is inhibited, leading to abnormal and dysregulated cell proliferation. Prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins are therefore tractable drug targets for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies, as well as immunotherapies. Small molecule antagonists of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins would be expected to restore normal apoptotic signaling in tumor cells by up-regulating proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein activity. These compounds may also be able to combat the resistance to chemotherapy which often develops in Bcl-2-overexpressing cancers.Synonyms and (human gene symbols);Bcl-2 (BCL2), Bcl-xL (BCL2L1), Bcl-w (BCL2L2), Mcl-1 (MCL1), Bcl2-A1 (BCL2A1), Bax (BAX), Bok (BOK), Bak (BAK1), Bad (BAD), Bid (BID), Bim (BCL2L11), Bmf (BMF), Bik (BIK), Hrk (HRK), Noxa (PMAIP1), Puma (BBC3), bNIP3 (BNIP3).",

The different dimers are selective for κ-B sites, and act as transcriptional repressors or activators. The most abundant NF-κB transcriptional activator is the heterodimer containing NFKB1 and RELA. The RELA-REL complex is also an activator.  NF-κB activity is tightly regulated. An inactive state is maintained by interactions between transcriptionally active complexes and inhibitory proteins of the NF-κB inhibitor (I-κB) family. In turn the I-κBs are regulated by phosphorylation (catalysed by kinases IKKα and IKKβ) which promotes ubiquitin dependent degradation. Removal of the I-κBs disinhibits NF-κB TFs which then translocate into the nucleus to drive transcription of target genes. Dysregulated NF-κB pathway activity is associated with human diseases.",

Most eukaryotes utilize the mevalonate (MVA) pathway (see our Lanosterol biosynthesis pathway page for more details), but phyla such as Plasmodium, that have acquired a plastid organelle, generate isoprenoids using the non-mevalonate or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. The complete pathway for P. falciparum is available at www.wikipathways.org and is shown below. Enzymes of the MEP pathway represent promising therapeutic targets for antimalarial drug development because the pathway is present in the Plasmodium parasite but not in the human host. In the malaria parasite, the products of the MEP pathway are metabolized further by the bifunctional farnesyl/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (PfFPPS/GGPPS) enzyme. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the coupling of IPP and DMAPP and is a key metabolic branch point in isoprenoid synthesis.

      "description": "The HMG family contains a number of structurally and functionally related nonhistone chromatin-associated proteins. A nomenclature strategy (hosted by the Mouse Gene Initiative ) indicates that the family can be divided into 3 subdivisions, HMGA, HMGB and HMGN. The human genome has 11 genes for HMG family proteins; HMGA1-2, HMGB1-4 and HMGN1-5. The HMGs regulate DNA-dependent processes (transcription, replication, recombination) and DNA repair, and are important in development and disease.",

The human genome has three synuclein genes, that encode synucleins alpha, beta and gamma. They are proposed to be involved in the regulation of membrane stability and/or turnover in healthy cells. Most is known about synuclein alpha due to its role in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

SORT1 and SOL1 are of therapeutic interest as they participate in inducing neurodegenerative processes. Antagonism of sortilin function provides neuroprotective effects.",
