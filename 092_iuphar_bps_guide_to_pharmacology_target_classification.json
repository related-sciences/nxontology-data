      "name": "G protein-coupled receptors",
      "description": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins in the human genome. The term \"7TM receptor\" is commonly used interchangeably with \"GPCR\", although there are some receptors with seven transmembrane domains that do not signal through G proteins. GPCRs share a common architecture, each consisting of a single polypeptide with an extracellular N-terminus, an intracellular C-terminus and seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7) linked by three extracellular loops (ECL1-ECL3) and three intracellular loops (ICL1-ICL3). About 800 GPCRs have been identified in man, of which about half have sensory functions, mediating olfaction (&#126;400), taste (33), light perception (10) and pheromone signalling (5). The remaining ~350 non-sensory GPCRs mediate signalling by ligands that range in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins; they are the targets for the majority of drugs in clinical usage , although only a minority of these receptors are exploited therapeutically. The first classification scheme to be proposed for GPCRs divided them, on the basic of sequence homology, into six classes. These classes and their prototype members were as follows: <b>Class A</b> (rhodopsin-like), <b>Class B</b> (secretin receptor family), <b>Class C</b> (metabotropic glutamate), <b>Class D</b> (fungal mating pheromone receptors), <b>Class E</b> (cyclic AMP receptors) and <b>Class F</b> (frizzled/smoothened). Of these, classes D and E are not found in vertebrates. An alternative classification scheme \"GRAFS\" divides vertebrate GPCRs into five classes, overlapping with the A-F nomenclature, <i>viz</i>: <br><br><b>Glutamate family (class C)</b>, which includes metabotropic glutamate receptors, a calcium-sensing receptor and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, as well as three taste type 1 receptors and a family of pheromone receptors (V2 receptors) that are abundant in rodents but absent in man.<br><br><b>Rhodopsin family (class A),</b> which includes receptors for a wide variety of small molecules, neurotransmitters, peptides and hormones, together with olfactory receptors, visual pigments, taste type 2 receptors and five pheromone receptors (V1 receptors). <br><br><b>Adhesion family</b> GPCRs are phylogenetically related to class B receptors, from which they differ by possessing large extracellular N-termini that are autoproteolytically cleaved from their 7TM domains at a conserved \"GPCR proteolysis site\" (GPS) which lies within a much larger (~320 residue) \"GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing\" (GAIN) domain, an evolutionary ancient mofif also found in polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1)-like proteins, which has been suggested to be both required and sufficient for autoproteolysis.<br><br><b>Frizzled family</b> consists of 10 Frizzled proteins (FZD(1-10)) and Smoothened (SMO).

[<sup>3</sup>H]prazosin and [<sup>125</sup>I]HEAT (BE2254) are relatively selective radioligands. S(+)-niguldipine also has high affinity for L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Fluorescent derivatives of prazosin (Bodipy PLprazosin- QAPB) are used to examine cellular localisation of &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. Selective &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists are used as nasal decongestants; antagonists to treat hypertension (doxazosin, prazosin) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (alfuzosin, tamsulosin). The &alpha;<sub>1</sub>- and &beta;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol is used to treat congestive heart failure, although the contribution of &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor blockade to the therapeutic effect is unclear.

Presynaptic &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors regulate many functions in the nervous system. The &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, guanabenz and brimonidine affect central baroreflex control (hypotension and bradycardia), induce hypnotic effects and analgesia, and modulate seizure activity and platelet aggregation. clonidine is an anti-hypertensive and counteracts opioid withdrawal. dexmedetomidine (also xylazine) is used as a sedative and analgesic in human and veterinary medicine with sympatholytic and anxiolytic properties. The &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine has been used to treat erectile dysfunction and mirtazapine as an anti-depressant.

Additional hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic roles have been identified for many chemokines in the areas of embryonic development, immune cell proliferation, activation and death, viral infection, and as antibiotics, among others. Chemokine receptors can be divided by function into two main groups: G protein-coupled chemokine receptors, which mediate leukocyte trafficking, and \"Atypical chemokine receptors\", which may signal through non-G protein-coupled mechanisms and act as chemokine scavengers to downregulate inflammation or shape chemokine gradients.<br><br>Chemokines in turn can be divided by structure into four subclasses by the number and arrangement of conserved cysteines. CC (also known as &beta;-chemokines; <i>n</i>= 28), CXC (also known as <em>&alpha;</em>-chemokines; <i>n</i>= 17) and CX3C (<i>n</i>= 1) chemokines all have four conserved cysteines, with zero, one and three amino acids separating the first two cysteines respectively. C chemokines (<i>n</i>= 2) have only the second and fourth cysteines found in other chemokines. Chemokines can also be classified by function into homeostatic and inflammatory subgroups. Most chemokine receptors are able to bind multiple high-affinity chemokine ligands, but the ligands for a given receptor are almost always restricted to the same structural subclass. Most chemokines bind to more than one receptor subtype. Receptors for inflammatory chemokines are typically highly promiscuous with regard to ligand specificity, and may lack a selective endogenous ligand. G protein-coupled chemokine receptors are named acccording to the class of chemokines bound, whereas ACKR is the root acronym for atypical chemokine receptors. There can be substantial cross-species differences in the sequences of both chemokines and chemokine receptors, and in the pharmacology and biology of chemokine receptors. Endogenous and microbial non-chemokine ligands have also been identified for chemokine receptors. Many chemokine receptors function as HIV co-receptors, but CCR5 is the only one demonstrated to play an essential role in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis.

While SMO shows structural resemblance to the 10 FZDs, it is functionally separated as it mediates effects in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. FZDs are activated by WNTs, which are cysteine-rich lipoglycoproteins with fundamental functions in ontogeny and tissue homeostasis. FZD signalling was initially divided into two pathways, being either dependent on the accumulation of the transcription regulator &beta;-catenin or being &beta;-catenin-independent (often referred to as canonical <i>vs.</i> non-canonical WNT/FZD signalling, respectively). WNT stimulation of FZDs can, in cooperation with the low density lipoprotein receptors <i>LRP5</i> (O75197) and <i>LRP6</i> (O75581), lead to the inhibition of a constitutively active destruction complex, which results in the accumulation of &beta;-catenin and subsequently its translocation to the nucleus. &beta;-Catenin, in turn, modifies gene transcription by interacting with TCF/LEF transcription factors. &beta;-Catenin-independent FZD signalling is far more complex with regard to the diversity of the activated pathways. WNT/FZD signalling can lead to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins , the elevation of intracellular calcium , activation of cGMP-specific PDE6 and elevation of cAMP as well as RAC-1, JNK, Rho and Rho kinase signalling. Novel resonance energy transfer-based tools have allowed the study of the GPCR-like nature of FZDs in greater detail. Upon ligand stimulation, FZDs undergo conformational changes and signal <i>via</i> heterotrimeric G proteins. Furthermore, the phosphoprotein Dishevelled constitutes a key player in WNT/FZD signalling. Importantly, FZDs exist in at least two distinct conformational states that regulate the pathway selection. As with other GPCRs, members of the Frizzled family are functionally dependent on the arrestin scaffolding protein for internalization , as well as for &beta;-catenin-dependent and -independent signalling. The pattern of cell signalling is complicated by the presence of additional ligands, which can enhance or inhibit FZD signalling (secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRP), Wnt-inhibitory factor (WIF), sclerostin or Dickkopf (DKK)), as well as modulatory (co)-receptors with Ryk, ROR1, ROR2 and Kremen, which may also function as independent signalling proteins.",

      "description": "Functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<b>nomenclature as agreed by the <u>NC-IUPHAR</u> Subcommittee on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors </b>) are formed from the heterodimerization of two similar 7TM subunits termed GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub>. GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are widespread in the CNS and regulate both pre- and postsynaptic activity. The GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit, when expressed alone, binds both antagonists and agonists, but the affinity of the latter is generally 10-100-fold less than for the native receptor. Co-expression of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits allows transport of GABA<sub>B1</sub> to the cell surface and generates a functional receptor that can couple to signal transduction pathways such as high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>2.1, Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2), or inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3). The GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit harbours the GABA (orthosteric)-binding site within an extracellular domain (ECD) venus flytrap module (VTM), whereas the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit mediates G protein-coupled signalling. The two subunits interact by direct allosteric coupling , such that GABA<sub>B2</sub> increases the affinity of GABA<sub>B1</sub> for agonists and reciprocally GABA<sub>B1</sub> facilitates the coupling of GABA<sub>B2</sub> to G proteins. GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunits assemble in a 1:1 stoichiometry by means of a coiled-coil interaction between &alpha;-helices within their carboxy-termini that masks an endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (RXRR) within the GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit but other domains of the proteins also contribute to their heteromerization. Recent evidence indicates that higher order assemblies of GABA<sub>B </sub>receptor comprising dimers of heterodimers occur in recombinant expression systems and <em>in vivo</em> and that such complexes exhibit negative functional cooperativity between heterodimers. Adding further complexity, KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization proteins) 8, 12, 12b and 16 associate as tetramers with the carboxy terminus of the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit to impart altered signalling kinetics and agonist potency to the receptor complex and are reviewed by. The molecular complexity of GABAB receptors is further increased through association with trafficking and effector proteins [Schwenk et al., 2016, Nature Neuroscience 19(2): 233-42] and reviewed by. Four isoforms of the human GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit have been cloned. The predominant GABA<sub>B1a</sub> and GABA<sub>B1b</sub> isoforms, which are most prevalent in neonatal and adult brain tissue respectively, differ in their ECD sequences as a result of the use of alternative transcription initiation sites. GABA<sub>B1a</sub>-containing heterodimers localise to distal axons and mediate inhibition of glutamate release in the CA3-CA1 terminals, and GABA release onto the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas GABA<sub>B1b</sub>-containing receptors occur within dendritic spines and mediate slow postsynaptic inhibition. Only the 1a and 1b variants are identified as components of native receptors. Additional GABA<sub>B1</sub> subunit isoforms have been described in rodents and humans and reviewed by.",

The structures of the VFTD of mGlu<sub>1</sub>, mGlu<sub>2</sub>, mGlu<sub>3</sub>, mGlu<sub>5</sub> and mGlu<sub>7</sub> have been solved. The structure of the 7 transmembrane (TM) domains of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 have been solved, and confirm a general helical organization similar to that of other GPCRs, although the helices appear more compacted. mGlu form constitutive dimers crosslinked by a disulfide bridge. Recent studies revealed the possible formation of heterodimers between either group-I receptors, or within and between group-II and -III receptors. Although well characterized in transfected cells, co-localization and specific pharmacological properties also suggest the existence of such heterodimers in the brain.<br><br> The endogenous ligands of mGlu are L-glutamic acid, L-serine-O-phosphate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate and L-cysteine sulphinic acid. Group-I mGlu receptors may be activated by 3,5-DHPG and (<i>S</i>)-3HPG and antagonized by (S)-hexylhomoibotenic acid. Group-II mGlu receptors may be activated by LY389795 , LY379268 , eglumegad , DCG-IV and (2<i>R</i>,3<i>R</i>)-APDC , and antagonised by eGlu and LY307452. Group-III mGlu receptors may be activated by L-AP4 and (<i>R,S</i>)-4-PPG. An example of an antagonist selective for mGlu receptors is LY341495, which blocks mGlu<sub>2</sub> and mGlu<sub>3</sub> at low nanomolar concentrations, mGlu<sub>8</sub> at high nanomolar concentrations, and mGlu<sub>4</sub>, mGlu<sub>5</sub>, and mGlu<sub>7</sub> in the micromolar range. In addition to orthosteric ligands that directly interact with the glutamate recognition site, allosteric modulators that bind within the TM domain have been described. Negative allosteric modulators are listed separately. The positive allosteric modulators most often act as ###?##?potentiators###?##?# of an orthosteric agonist response, without significantly activating the receptor in the absence of agonist.",

They regulate (either promoting or repressing) transcription of these target genes in response to a variety of endogenous ligands. Endogenous agonists are hydrophobic entities which, when bound to the receptor promote conformational changes in the receptor to allow recruitment (or dissociation) of protein partners, generating a large multiprotein complex.<br><br>Two major subclasses of nuclear receptors with identified endogenous agonists can be identified: steroid and non-steroid hormone receptors. Steroid hormone receptors function typically as dimeric entities and are thought to be resident outside the nucleus in the unliganded state in a complex with chaperone proteins, which are liberated upon agonist binding. Migration to the nucleus and interaction with other regulators of gene transcription, including RNA polymerase, acetyltransferases and deacetylases, allows gene transcription to be regulated. Non-steroid hormone receptors typically exhibit a greater distribution in the nucleus in the unliganded state and interact with other nuclear receptors to form heterodimers, as well as with other regulators of gene transcription, leading to changes in gene transcription upon agonist binding. <br><br>Selectivity of gene regulation is brought about through interaction of nuclear receptors with particular consensus sequences of DNA, which are arranged typically as repeats or inverted palindromes to allow accumulation of multiple transcription factors in the promoter regions of genes.",

      "name": "Catalytic receptors",
      "description": "Catalytic receptors are cell-surface proteins, usually dimeric in nature, which encompass ligand binding and functional domains in one polypeptide chain. The ligand binding domain is placed on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane and separated from the functional domain by a single transmembrane-spanning domain of 20-25 hydrophobic amino acids. The functional domain on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane has catalytic activity, or interacts with particular enzymes, giving the superfamily of receptors its name. Endogenous agonists of the catalytic receptor superfamily are peptides or proteins, the binding of which may induce dimerization of the receptor, which is the functional version of the receptor.<br><br>Amongst the catalytic receptors, particular subfamilies may be readily identified dependent on the function of the enzymatic portion of the receptor. The smallest group is the particulate guanylyl cyclases of the natriuretic peptide receptor family. The most widely recognized group is probably the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, epitomized by the neurotrophin receptor family, where a crucial initial step is the activation of a signalling cascade by autophosphorylation of the receptor on intracellular tyrosine residue(s) catalyzed by enzyme activity intrinsic to the receptor. A third group is the extrinsic protein tyrosine kinase receptors, where the catalytic activity resides in a separate protein from the binding site. Examples of this group include the GDNF and ErbB receptor families, where one, catalytically silent, member of the heterodimer is activated upon binding the ligand, causing the second member of the heterodimer, lacking ligand binding capacity, to initiate signaling through tyrosine phosphorylation. A fourth group, the receptor threonine/serine kinase (RTSK) family, exemplified by TGF-&beta; and BMP receptors, has intrinsic serine/threonine protein kinase activity in the heterodimeric functional unit. A fifth group is the receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RTP), which appear to lack cognate ligands, but may be triggered by events such as cell:cell contact and have identified roles in the skeletal, hematopoietic and immune systems.<br><br>A further group of catalytic receptors for the Guide is the integrins, which have roles in cell:cell communication, often associated with signaling in the blood.",

      "name": "Cytokine receptor family",
      "description": "Cytokines are not a clearly defined group of agents, other than having an impact on immune signalling pathways, although many cytokines have effects on other systems, such as in development. A feature of some cytokines, which allows them to be distinguished from hormones, is that they may be produced by ###?##?non-secretory###?#? cells, for example, endothelial cells. Within the cytokine receptor family, some subfamilies may be identified, which are described elsewhere in the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, receptors for the TNF family, the TGF-&beta; family and the chemokines. Within this group of records are described Type I cytokine receptors, typified by interleukin receptors, and Type II cytokine receptors, exemplified by interferon receptors. These receptors possess a conserved extracellular region, known as the cytokine receptor homology domain (CHD), along with a range of other structural modules, including extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and fibronectin type III (FBNIII)-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and intracellular homology domains. An unusual feature of this group of agents is the existence of soluble and decoy receptors. These bind cytokines without allowing signalling to occur. A further attribute is the production of endogenous antagonist molecules, which bind to the receptors selectively and prevent signalling. A commonality of these families of receptors is the ligand-induced homo- or hetero-oligomerisation, which results in the recruitment of intracellular protein partners to evoke cellular responses, particularly in inflammatory or haematopoietic signalling. Although not an exclusive signalling pathway, a common feature of the majority of cytokine receptors is activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. This cascade is based around the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the Janus kinases (JAK), which phosphorylate the receptor and thereby facilitate the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The activated homo- or heterodimeric STATs function principally as transcription factors in the nucleus.<br><br><b>Type I cytokine receptors</b> are characterized by two pairs of conserved cysteines linked via disulfide bonds and a C-terminal WSXWS motif within their CHD. Type I receptors are commonly classified into five groups, based on sequence and structual homology of the receptor and its cytokine ligand, which is potentially more reflective of evolutionary relationships than an earlier scheme based on the use of common signal transducing chains within a receptor complex.<br><br><b>Type II cytokine receptors</b> also have two pairs of conserved cysteines but with a different arrangement to Type I and also lack the WSXWS motif.",

A set of rare autoimmune disorders known as type I interferonopathies are caused by disturbance of the homeostatic control of induction, transmission, and resolution of the type I IFN-mediated immune response. Therefore, members of this signaling pathway are subject to investigation as intervention points for pharmacological inhibition. Initial investigations targeted IFN-I downstream signaling, including IFN-I proteins, IFNAR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. For example, sifalimumab (anti-IFN-&alpha; mAb), anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR1) and the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, can all potentially tackle the effector function of dysregulated IFN by blocking downstream IFN-I signaling, but do not contribute to reducing the production of IFN. Upstream targeting of TBK1 and/or IKK&epsilon; could be effective at blocking <i>de novo</i> IFN-I induction by a variety of stimuli. Small molecule kinase inhibitors of TBK1/IKK&epsilon; already in development for cancer may expedite investigation for inflammatory diseases also.",

In the human genome, 58 RTKs have been identified, which fall into 20 families. <br><br>All RTKs display an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a cytoplasmic region containing the protein tyrosine kinase activity (occasionally split into two domains by an insertion, termed the kinase insertion), with juxta-membrane and C-terminal regulatory regions. Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-&gamma;, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. <br><br> RTKs are of widespread interest not only through physiological functions, but also as drug targets in many types of cancer and other disease states. Many diseases result from genetic changes or abnormalities that either alter the activity, abundance, cellular distribution and/or regulation of RTKs. Therefore, drugs that modify the dysregulated functions of these RTKs have been developed which fall into two categories. One group is often described as ###?##?biologicals###?##?#, which block the activation of RTKs directly or by chelating the cognate ligands, while the second are small molecules designed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity directly.",

Intriguingly, the endogenous peptide ligands are formed in a parallel fashion with post-translational processing producing a heterodimer linked by disulphide bridges. Signalling through the receptors is mediated through a rapid autophosphorylation event at intracellular tyrosine residues, followed by recruitment of multiple adaptor proteins, notably <i>IRS1</i> (P35568), <i>IRS2</i> (Q9Y4H2), <i>SHC1</i> (P29353), <i>GRB2</i> (P62993) and <i>SOS1</i> (Q07889).<br><br>Serum levels of free IGFs are kept low by the action of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1-5, P08833, P18065, P17936, P22692, P24593), which sequester the IGFs; overexpression of IGFBPs may induce apoptosis, while IGFBP levels are also altered in some cancers.",

Agonist binding initiates formation of a cell-surface complex of type I and type II RSTK, possibly heterotetrameric, where where both subunits express serine/threonine kinase activity. The type I receptor serine/threonine kinases are also known as activin receptors or activin receptor-like kinases, ALKs, for which a systematic nomenclature has been proposed (ALK1-7). The type II protein phosphorylates the kinase domain of the type I partner (sometimes referred to as the signal propagating subunit), causing displacement of the protein partners, such as the FKBP12 FK506-binding protein <i>FKBP1A</i> (P62942) and allowing the binding and phosphorylation of particular members of the Smad family. These migrate to the nucleus and act as complexes to regulate gene transcription. Type III receptors, sometimes called co-receptors or accessory proteins, regulate the signalling of the receptor complex, in either enhancing (for example, presenting the ligand to the receptor) or inhibitory manners. TGF&beta; family ligand signalling may be inhibited by endogenous proteins, such as follistatin, which binds and neutralizes activins to prevent activation of the target receptors.<br><br>Endogenous agonists, approximately 30 in man, are often described as paracrine messengers acting close to the source of production. They are characterized by six conserved cysteine residues and are divided into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence comparison and signalling pathways activated, the TGF&beta;/activin/nodal subfamily and the BMP/GDF (growth/differentiation factor)/MIS (M&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance) subfamily. Ligands active at RSTKs appear to be generated as large precursors which undergo complex maturation processes. Some are known to form disulphide-linked homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes.

Based on this association between extracellular signals and intracellular protein kinase activity, we have chosen to include integrins in the 'Catalytic receptors' section of the database until more stringent criteria from NC-IUPHAR allows precise definition of their classification.<br><br>Integrins are heterodimeric entities, composed of &alpha; and &beta; subunits, each 1TM proteins, which bind components of the extracellular matrix or counter-receptors expressed on other cells. One class of integrin contains an inserted domain (I) in its &alpha; subunit, and if present (in &alpha;1, &alpha;2, &alpha;10, &alpha;11, &alpha;D, &alpha;E, &alpha;L, &alpha;M and &alpha;X), this I domain contains the ligand binding site. All &beta; subunits possess a similar I-like domain, which has the capacity to bind ligand, often recognising the RGD motif. The presence of an &alpha; subunit I domain precludes ligand binding through the &beta; subunit. Integrins provide a link between ligand and the actin cytoskeleton (through typically short intracellular domains). Integrins bind several divalent cations, including a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the I or I-like domain that is essential for ligand binding. Other cation binding sites may regulate integrin activity or stabilise the 3D structure. Integrins regulate the activity of particular protein kinases, including focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase. Cellular activation regulates integrin ligand affinity <i>via</i> inside-out signalling and ligand binding to integrins can regulate cellular activity <i>via</i> outside-in signalling.<br><br>Several drugs that target integrins are in clinical use including: (1) abciximab (&alpha;IIb&beta;3) for short term prevention of coronary thrombosis, (2) vedolizumab (&alpha;4&beta;7) to reduce gastrointestinal inflammation, and (3) natalizumab (&alpha;4&beta;1) in some cases of severe multiple sclerosis.",

As such, there is some blurring of the boundaries between \"ion channels\" and \"ligand-gated channels\" which are compiled separately in the Guide. Resolution of ion channel structures, beginning with K channels then Cl channels and most recently Na channels has greatly improved understanding of the structural basis behind ion channel function. Many ion channels (<i>e.g.</i>, K, Na, Ca, HCN and TRP channels) share several structural similarities. These channels are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor and have been classfied together as the \"voltage-gated-like (VGL) ion channel chanome\" (see ). Other ion channels, however, such as Cl channels, aquaporins and connexins, have completely different structural properties to the VGL channels, having evolved quite separately.<br><br>Currently, ion channels (including ligand-gated ion channels) represent the second largest target for existing drugs after G protein-coupled receptors.

      "description": "<p>The TRP superfamily of channels (<b>nomenclature as agreed by <u>NC-IUPHAR</u> </b>), whose founder member is the <i>Drosophila</i> Trp channel, exists in mammals as six families; TRPC, TRPM, TRPV, TRPA, TRPP and TRPML based on amino acid homologies. TRP subunits contain six putative transmembrane domains and assemble as homo- or hetero-tetramers to form cation selective channels with diverse modes of activation and varied permeation properties (reviewed by ). Established, or potential, physiological functions of the individual members of the TRP families are discussed in detail in the recommended reviews and in a number of books. The established, or potential, involvement of TRP channels in disease is reviewed in and , together with a special edition of <i>Biochemica et Biophysica Acta</i> on the subject. Additional disease related reviews, for pain , stroke , sensation and inflammation , itch , and airway disease , are available. The pharmacology of most TRP channels has been advanced in recent years. Broad spectrum agents are listed in the tables along with more selective, or recently recognised, ligands that are flagged by the inclusion of a primary reference. See Rubaiy (2019) for a review of pharmacological tools for TRPC1/C4/C5 channels. Most TRP channels are regulated by phosphoinostides such as PtIns(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub> although the effects reported are often complex, occasionally contradictory, and likely to be dependent upon experimental conditions, such as intracellular ATP levels (reviewed by ). Such regulation is generally not included in the tables.When thermosensitivity is mentioned, it refers specifically to a high Q10 of gating, often in the range of 10-30, but does not necessarily imply that the channel's function is to act as a 'hot' or 'cold' sensor. In general, the search for TRP activators has led to many claims for temperature sensing, mechanosensation, and lipid sensing. All proteins are of course sensitive to energies of binding, mechanical force, and temperature, but the issue is whether the proposed input is within a physiologically relevant range resulting in a response. </p><heading>TRPA (ankyrin) family</heading><p>TRPA1 is the sole mammalian member of this group (reviewed by ). TRPA1 activation of sensory neurons contribute to nociception. Pungent chemicals such as mustard oil (AITC), allicin, and cinnamaldehyde activate TRPA1 by modification of free thiol groups of cysteine side chains, especially those located in its amino terminus. Alkenals with &alpha;, &beta;-unsaturated bonds, such as propenal , butenal , and 2-pentenal can react with free thiols <i>via</i> Michael addition and can activate TRPA1. However, potency appears to weaken as carbon chain length increases. Covalent modification leads to sustained activation of TRPA1. Chemicals including carvacrol, menthol, and local anesthetics reversibly activate TRPA1 by non-covalent binding. TRPA1 is not mechanosensitive under physiological conditions, but can be activated by cold temperatures. The electron cryo-EM structure of TRPA1 indicates that it is a 6-TM homotetramer. Each subunit of the channel contains two short ###?##?pore helices###?##?# pointing into the ion selectivity filter, which is big enough to allow permeation of partially hydrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. </p><heading>TRPC (canonical) family</heading><p>Members of the TRPC subfamily (reviewed by ) fall into the subgroups outlined below. TRPC2 is a pseudogene in humans. It is generally accepted that all TRPC channels are activated downstream of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptors, or receptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed by ). A comprehensive listing of G-protein coupled receptors that activate TRPC channels is given in. Hetero-oligomeric complexes of TRPC channels and their association with proteins to form signalling complexes are detailed in and. TRPC channels have frequently been proposed to act as store-operated channels (SOCs) (or compenents of mulimeric complexes that form SOCs), activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (reviewed by ). However, the weight of the evidence is that they are not directly gated by conventional store-operated mechanisms, as established for Stim-gated Orai channels. TRPC channels are not mechanically gated in physiologically relevant ranges of force. All members of the TRPC family are blocked by 2-APB and SKF96365. Activation of TRPC channels by lipids is discussed by. Important progress has been recently made in TRPC pharmacology. TRPC channels regulate a variety of physiological functions and are implicated in many human diseases. <br><br><b>TRPC1/C4/C5 subgroup</b><br> TRPC1 alone may not form a functional ion channel. TRPC4/C5 may be distinguished from other TRP channels by their potentiation by micromolar concentrations of La<sup>3+</sup>. TRPC2 is a pseudogene in humans, but in other mammals appears to be an ion channel localized to microvilli of the vomeronasal organ. It is required for normal sexual behavior in response to pheromones in mice. It may also function in the main olfactory epithelia in mice.<br><br><b>TRPC3/C6/C7 subgroup</b><br> All members are activated by diacylglycerol independent of protein kinase C stimulation.</p><heading>TRPM (melastatin) family</heading><p>Members of the TRPM subfamily (reviewed by ) fall into the five subgroups outlined below. <br><br><b>TRPM1/M3 subgroup</b><br>In darkness, glutamate released by the photoreceptors and ON-bipolar cells binds to the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 , leading to activation of Go. This results in the closure of TRPM1. When the photoreceptors are stimulated by light, glutamate release is reduced, and TRPM1 channels are more active, resulting in cell membrane depolarization. Human TRPM1 mutations are associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), whose patients lack rod function. TRPM1 is also found melanocytes. Isoforms of TRPM1 may present in melanocytes, melanoma, brain, and retina. In melanoma cells, TRPM1 is prevalent in highly dynamic intracellular vesicular structures. TRPM3 (reviewed by ) exists as multiple splice variants which differ significantly in their biophysical properties. TRPM3 is expressed in somatosensory neurons and may be important in development of heat hyperalgesia during inflammation (see review ). TRPM3 is frequently coexpressed with TRPA1 and TRPV1 in these neurons. TRPM3 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells as well as brain, pituitary gland, eye, kidney, and adipose tissue.

Numerous splice variants of TRPM2 exist which differ in their activation mechanisms. The C-terminal domain contains a TRP motif, a coiled-coil region, and an enzymatic NUDT9 homologous domain. TRPM2 appears not to be activated by NAD, NAAD, or NAADP, but is directly activated by ADPRP (adenosine-5'-O-disphosphoribose phosphate).

      "description": "Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are integral membrane proteins that contain a pore which allows the regulated flow of selected ions across the plasma membrane. Ion flux is passive and driven by the electrochemical gradient for the permeant ions. These channels are open, or gated, by the binding of a neurotransmitter to an orthosteric site(s) that triggers a conformational change that results in the conducting state. Modulation of gating can occur by the binding of endogenous, or exogenous, modulators to allosteric sites. LGICs mediate fast synaptic transmission, on a millisecond time scale, in the nervous system and at the somatic neuromuscular junction. Such transmission involves the release of a neurotransmitter from a pre-synaptic neurone and the subsequent activation of post-synaptically located receptors that mediate a rapid, phasic, electrical signal (the excitatory, or inhibitory, post-synaptic potential). However, in addition to their traditional role in phasic neurotransmission, it is now established that some LGICs mediate a tonic form of neuronal regulation that results from the activation of extra-synaptic receptors by ambient levels of neurotransmitter. The expression of some LGICs by non-excitable cells is suggestive of additional functions.<br><br>By convention, the LGICs comprise the excitatory, cation-selective, nicotinic acetylcholine , 5-HT3 , ionotropic glutamate and P2X receptors and the inhibitory, anion-selective, GABAA and glycine receptors. The nicotinic acetylcholine, 5-HT3, GABAA and glycine receptors (and an additional zinc-activated channel) are pentameric structures and are frequently referred to as the Cys-loop receptors due to the presence of a defining loop of residues formed by a disulphide bond in the extracellular domain of their constituent subunits. However, the prokaryotic ancestors of these receptors contain no such loop and the term pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) is gaining acceptance in the literature. The ionotropic glutamate and P2X receptors are tetrameric and trimeric structures, respectively. Multiple genes encode the subunits of LGICs and the majority of these receptors are heteromultimers. Such combinational diversity results, within each class of LGIC, in a wide range of receptors with differing pharmacological and biophysical properties and varying patterns of expression within the nervous system and other tissues. The LGICs thus present attractive targets for new therapeutic agents with improved discrimination between receptor isoforms and a reduced propensity for off-target effects. The development of novel, faster screening techniques for compounds acting on LGICs will greatly aid in the development of such agents.",

Five human 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor subunits have been cloned and homo-oligomeric assemblies of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>B subunits have been characterised in detail.

Sequences of six &alpha;, three &beta;, three &gamma;, one &delta;, three &rho;, one &epsilon;, one &pi; and one &theta; GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits have been reported in mammals.

For example, extrasynaptically located receptors that contain &alpha;6- and &delta;-subunits in cerebellar granule cells, or an &alpha;4- and &delta;-subunit in dentate gyrus granule cells and thalamic neurones, mediate a tonic current that is important for neuronal excitability in response to ambient concentrations of GABA.

Two additional kainate receptor subunits, GluK4 and GluK5, when expressed individually, form high affinity binding sites for kainate, but lack function, but can form heteromers when expressed with GluK1-3 subunits (<i>e.g</i>. GluK2/K5; reviewed in ). Kainate receptors may also exhibit ###?##?metabotropic###?##?# functions. As found for AMPA receptors, kainate receptors are modulated by auxiliary subunits (Neto proteins, ). An important function difference between AMPA and kainate receptors is that the latter require extracellular Na+ and Cl- for their activation. RNA encoding the GluA2 subunit undergoes extensive RNA editing in which the codon encoding a p-loop glutamine residue (Q) is converted to one encoding arginine (R). This Q/R site strongly influences the biophysical properties of the receptor. Recombinant AMPA receptors lacking RNA edited GluA2 subunits are: (1) permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>; (2) blocked by intracellular polyamines at depolarized potentials causing inward rectification (the latter being reduced by TARPs); (3) blocked by extracellular argiotoxin and Joro spider toxins and (4) demonstrate higher channel conductances than receptors containing the edited form of GluA2. GluK1 and GluK2, but not other kainate receptor subunits, are similarly edited and broadly similar functional characteristics apply to kainate receptors lacking either an RNA edited GluK1, or GluK2, subunit. Native AMPA and kainate receptors displaying differential channel conductances, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeabilites and sensitivity to block by intracellular polyamines have been identified. GluA1-4 can exist as two variants generated by alternative splicing (termed ###?##?flip###?##?# and ###?##?flop###?##?#) that differ in their desensitization kinetics and their desensitization in the presence of cyclothiazide which stabilises the nondesensitized state. TARPs also stabilise the non-desensitized conformation of AMPA receptors and facilitate the action of cyclothiazide. Splice variants of GluK1-3 also exist which affects their trafficking.",

      "name": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors",
      "description": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of the Cys-loop family of transmitter-gated ion channels that includes the GABA<sub>A</sub>, strychnine-sensitive glycine and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. All nicotinic receptors are pentamers in which each of the five subunits contains four &alpha;-helical transmembrane domains. Genes encoding a total of 17 subunits (&alpha;1-10, &beta;1-4, &gamma;, &delta; and &epsilon;) have been identified. All subunits with the exception of &alpha;8 (present in avian species) have been identified in mammals. All &alpha; subunits possess two tandem cysteine residues near to the site involved in acetylcholine binding, and subunits not named &alpha; lack these residues. The orthosteric ligand binding site is formed by residues within at least three peptide domains on the &alpha; subunit (principal component), and three on the adjacent subunit (complementary component). nAChRs contain several allosteric modulatory sites. One such site, for positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and allosteric agonists, has been proposed to reside within an intrasubunit cavity between the four transmembrane domains ; see also ). The high resolution crystal structure of the molluscan acetylcholine binding protein, a structural homologue of the extracellular binding domain of a nicotinic receptor pentamer, in complex with several nicotinic receptor ligands (<i>e.g.</i>) and the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the &alpha;1 subunit bound to &alpha;-bungarotoxin at 1.94 #?#?# resolution , has revealed the orthosteric binding site in detail (reviewed in ). Nicotinic receptors at the somatic neuromuscular junction of adult animals have the stoichiometry (&alpha;1)<sub>2</sub>&beta;1&delta;&epsilon;, whereas an extrajunctional (&alpha;1)<sub>2</sub>&beta;1&gamma;&delta; receptor predominates in embryonic and denervated skeletal muscle and other pathological states. Other nicotinic receptors are assembled as combinations of &alpha;(2-6) and &beta(2-4) subunits. For &alpha;2, &alpha;3, &alpha;4 and &beta;2 and &beta;4 subunits, pairwise combinations of &alpha; and &beta; (<i>e.g.</i> &alpha;3&beta;4 and &alpha;4&beta;2) are sufficient to form a functional receptor <i>in vitro</i>, but far more complex isoforms may exist <i>in vivo</i> (reviewed in ). There is strong evidence that the pairwise assembly of some &alpha; and &beta; subunits can occur with variable stoichiometry [<i>e.g.</i> (&alpha;4)<sub>2</sub>(&beta;2)<sub>2</sub> or (&alpha;4)<sub>3</sub>(&beta;2)<sub>2</sub>] which influences the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the receptor. &alpha;5 and &beta;3 subunits lack function when expressed alone, or pairwise, but participate in the formation of functional hetero-oligomeric receptors when expressed as a third subunit with another &alpha; and &beta; pair [e.g. &alpha;4&alpha;5&alpha;&beta;2, &alpha;4&alpha;&beta;2&beta;3, &alpha;5&alpha;6&beta;2, see for further examples]. The &alpha;6 subunit can form a functional receptor when co-expressed with &beta;4 <i>in vitro</i>, but more efficient expression ensues from incorporation of a third partner, such as &beta;3. The &alpha;7, &alpha;8, and &alpha;9 subunits form functional homo-oligomers, but can also combine with a second subunit to constitute a hetero-oligomeric assembly (<i>e.g.</i> &alpha;7&beta;2 and &alpha;9&alpha;10). For functional expression of the &alpha;10 subunit, co-assembly with &alpha;9 is necessary. The latter, along with the &alpha;10 subunit, appears to be largely confined to cochlear and vestibular hair cells. Comprehensive listings of nicotinic receptor subunit combinations identified from recombinant expression systems, or <i>in vivo</i>, are given in. In addition, numerous proteins interact with nicotinic ACh receptors modifying their assembly, trafficking to and from the cell surface, and activation by ACh (reviewed by ).<br><br>The nicotinic receptor Subcommittee of <u><b>NC-IUPHAR</b></u> has recommended a nomenclature and classification scheme for nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors based on the subunit composition of known, naturally- and/or heterologously-expressed nACh receptor subtypes.

An asterisk following the indicated &alpha; subunit denotes that other subunits are known to, or may, assemble with the indicated &alpha; subunit to form the designated nACh receptor subtype(s).

      "description": "The epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the distal kidney tubules, lung, respiratory tract, male and female reproductive tracts, sweat and salivary glands, placenta, colon and some other organs. In these epithelia, ENaC allows flow of Na<sup>+</sup> ions from the extracellular fluid in the lumen into the epithelial cell. Na<sup>+</sup> ions are then pumped out of the cytoplasm into the interstitial fluid by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase located on the basolateral membrane. As Na<sup>+</sup> is one of the major electrolytes in the extracellular fluid (ECF), osmolarity change initiated by the Na<sup>+</sup> flow is accompanied by a flow of water accompanying Na<sup>+</sup> ions. Thus, ENaC has a central role in the regulation of ECF volume and blood pressure, especially via its function in the kidney. The expression of ENaC subunits, hence its activity, is regulated by the renin-angotensin-aldosterone system, and other factors that are involved in electrolyte homeostasis. In the respiratory tract and female reproductive tract large segments of the tracts are covered by multi-ciliated cells. In these cells ENaC has been shown to be located along the entire length of the cilia. Cilial location greatly increases ENaC density per cell surface and allows ENaC to serve as a sensitive regulator of osmolarity of the periciliary fluid throughout the whole depth of the fluid bathing the cilia. In contrast to ENaC, CFTR that is defective in cystic fibrosis is not located on non-cilial cell-surface. Thus, ENaC function is also essential for the clearance of respiratory airways, transport of germ cells, fertilization, implantation and cell migration. ENaC has been recently localized in the germinal epithelium of the testis, Sertoli cells, spermatozoa, along the epididymis ducts, and smooth muscle cells. Evidence has been provided that rare mutations in ENaC are associated with female infertility.",

Since the isolation and cloning of the first aquaporin (AQP1) , 12 additional mammalian members of the family have been identified, although little is known about the functional properties of one of these (<i>AQP12A</i>; Q8IXF9) and it is thus not tabulated. The other 12 aquaporins can be broadly divided into three families: orthodox aquaporins (AQP0,-1,-2,-4,-5, -6 and -8) permeable mainly to water, but for some additional solutes ; aquaglyceroporins (AQP3,-7 -9 and -10), additionally permeable to glycerol and for some isoforms urea , and superaquaporins (AQP11 and 12) located within cells. Some aquaporins also conduct ammonia and/or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> giving rise to the terms 'ammoniaporins' ('aquaammoniaporins') and 'peroxiporins', respectively. Aquaporins are impermeable to protons and other inorganic and organic cations, with the possible exception of AQP1. One or more members of this family of proteins have been found to be expressed in almost all tissues of the body [reviewed in Yang (2017) ]. AQPs are involved in numerous processes that include systemic water homeostasis, adipocyte metabolism, brain oedema, cell migration and fluid secretion by epithelia and loss of function mutations of some human AQPs, or their disruption by autoantibodies further underscore their importance [reviewed by Verkman <i>et al</i>.

In addition to the four pores contributed by the protomers, an additional hydrophobic pore exists within the center of the complex that may mediate the transport of gases (<i>e.g.</i> O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO) and cations (the central pore is the proposed transport pathway for cations through AQP1) by some AQPs. Although numerous small molecule inhibitors of aquaporins, particularly APQ1, have been reported primarily from <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte swelling assays, the activity of most has subsequently been disputed upon retesting using assays of water transport that are less prone to various artifacts and they are therefore excluded from the tables [see Tradtrantip <i>et al.</i> (2017) for a review].",

Of the 1700 mutations identified in CFTR, the most common is the deletion mutant &Delta;F508 (a class 2 mutation) which results in impaired trafficking of CFTR and reduces its incorporation into the plasma membrane causing cystic fibrosis (reviewed in ). Channels carrying the &Delta;F508 mutation that do traffic to the plasma membrane demonstrate gating defects. Thus, pharmacological restoration of the function of the &Delta;F508 mutant would require a compound that embodies 'corrector' (<i>i.e.</i> facilitates folding and trafficking to the cell surface) and 'potentiator' (<i>i.e.</i> promotes opening of channels at the cell surface) activities. In addition to acting as an anion channel <i>per se</i>, CFTR may act as a regulator of several other conductances including inhibition of the epithelial Na channel (ENaC), calcium activated chloride channels (CaCC) and volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), activation of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC), and enhancement of the sulphonylurea sensitivity of the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK2), (reviewed in ). CFTR also regulates TRPV4, which provides the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal for regulatory volume decrease in airway epithelia. The activities of CFTR and the chloride-bicarbonate exchangers SLC26A3 (DRA) and SLC26A6 (PAT1) are mutually enhanced by a physical association between the regulatory (R) domain of CFTR and the STAS domain of the SCL26 transporters, an effect facilitated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain of CFTR.",

The molecular nature of CaCC has been uncertain with both <i>CLCA</i>, <i>TWEETY</i> and<i> BEST</i> genes having been considered as likely candidates. It is now accepted that CLCA expression products are unlikely to form channels <i>per se</i> and probably function as cell adhesion proteins, or are secreted. Similarly, <i>TWEETY</i> gene products do not recapictulate the properties of endogenous CaCC. The bestrophins encoded by genes <i>BEST1-4</i> have a topology more consistent with ion channels and form chloride channels that are activated by physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but whether such activation is direct is not known. However, currents generated by bestrophin over-expression do not resemble native CaCC currents. The evidence for and against bestrophin proteins forming CaCC is critically reviewed by Duran <i>et al.</i>. Recently, a new gene family, TMEM16 (anoctamin) consisting of 10 members (TMEM16A-K; anoctamin 1-10) has been identified and there is firm evidence that some of these members form chloride channels. TMEM16A (anoctamin 1; Ano 1) produces Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents with kinetics similar to native CaCC currents recorded from different cell types.

However, whether Na<sub>Vi</sub>2.1 is constitutively active has been challenged. Na<sub>Vi</sub>2.1 is widely distributed within the central nervous system and is also expressed in the heart and pancreas specifically, in rodents, within the islets of Langerhans.

The Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) classifies enzymes into families, using a four number code, on the basis of the reactions they catalyse. There are six main families:<br><br>EC 1.-.-.- Oxidoreductases;<br>EC 2.-.-.- Transferases;<br>EC 3.-.-.- Hydrolases;<br>EC 4.-.-.- Lyases;<br> EC 5.-.-.- Isomerases;<br>EC 6.-.-.- Ligases.<br><br>Although there are many more enzymes than receptors in biology, and many drugs that target prokaryotic enzymes are effective medicines, overall the number of enzyme drug targets is relatively small , which is not to say that they are of modest importance.<br><br>The majority of drugs which act on enzymes act as inhibitors; one exception is metformin, which appears to stimulate activity of AMP-activated protein kinase, albeit through an imprecisely-defined mechanism. Kinetic assays allow discrimination of competitive, non-competitive, and un-competitive inhibitors. The majority of inhibitors are competitive (acting at the enzyme's ligand recognition site), non-competitive (acting at a distinct site; potentially interfering with co-factor or co-enzyme binding) or of mixed type. One rare example of an uncompetitive inhibitor is lithium ions, which are effective inhibitors at inositol monophosphatase only in the presence of high substrate concentrations. Some inhibitors are irreversible, including a group known as suicide substrates, which bind to the ligand recognition site and then couple covalently to the enzyme. It is beyond the scope of the Guide to give mechanistic information about the inhibitors described, although generally this information is available from the indicated literature.<br><br>Many enzymes require additional entities for functional activity. Some of these are used in the catalytic steps, while others promote a particular conformational change. Co-factors are tightly bound to the enzyme and include metal ions and heme groups. Co-enzymes are typically small molecules which accept or donate functional groups to assist in the enzymatic reaction. Examples include ATP, NAD, NADP and S-adenosylmethionine, as well as a number of vitamins, such as riboflavin (vitamin B1) and thiamine (vitamin B2). Where co-factors/co-enzymes have been identified, the Guide indicates their involvement.",

There are 3 NOS isoforms and they are related by their capacity to produce NO, highly conserved organization of functional domains and significant homology at the amino acid level. NOS isoforms are functionally distinguished by the cell type where they are expressed, intracellular targeting and transcriptional and post-translation mechanisms regulating enzyme activity. The nomenclature suggested by <b>NC-IUPHAR </b>of NOS I, II and III has not gained wide acceptance, and the 3 isoforms are more commonly referred to as neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) which reflect the location of expression (nNOS and eNOS) and inducible expression (iNOS). All are dimeric enzymes that shuttle electrons from NADPH, which binds to a C-terminal reductase domain, through the flavins FAD and FMN to the oxygenase domain of the other monomer to enable the BH4-dependent reduction of heme bound oxygen for insertion into the substrate, L-arginine. Electron flow from reductase to oxygenase domain is controlled by calmodulin binding to canonical calmodulin binding motif located between these domains. eNOS and nNOS isoforms are activated at concentrations of calcium greater than 100 nM, while iNOS shows higher affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin with great avidity and is essentially calcium-independent and constitutively active. Efficient stimulus-dependent coupling of nNOS and eNOS is achieved <i>via</i> subcellular targeting through respective N-terminal PDZ and fatty acid acylation domains whereas iNOS is largely cytosolic and function is independent of intracellular location. nNOS is primarily expressed in the brain and neuronal tissue, iNOS in immune cells such as macrophages and eNOS in the endothelial layer of the vasculature although exceptions in other cells have been documented. L-NAME and related modified arginine analogues are inhibitors of all three isoforms, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range.",

There are splice variants of each isoform (SphK1a-c and SphK2a, b), distinguished by their N-terminal sequences. SPHK1 and SPHK2 differ in tissue distribution, sub-cellular localisation, biochemical properties and regulation. They regulate discrete pools of S1P. Receptor stimulation induces SPHK1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. SPHK1 translocation is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, specific protein:protein interactions and interaction with specific lipids at the plasma membrane. SPHK1 is a dimeric protein, as confirmed by its crystal structure which forms a positive cluster, between protomers, essential for interaction with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. SPHK2 is localised to the ER or associated with mitochondria or shuttles in/out of the nucleus, regulated by phosphorylation. Intracellular targets of nuclear S1P include the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) and regulators of gene expression including histone deacetylases (HDAC 1/2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&gamma;). SPHK2 phosphorylates the pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, which is used to treat some forms of multiple sclerosis) to a mimic of S1P and that acts as a functional antagonist of S1P<sub>1</sub> receptors. Inhibitors of SPHK1 and SPHK2 have therapeutic potential in many diseases.",

      "description": "The I&kappa;B kinase (IKK)-related kinases are central to the induction of the innate type I interferon (IFN) response. A set of rare autoimmune disorders known as type I interferonopathies are caused by disturbance of the homeostatic control of induction, transmission, and resolution of the type I IFN-mediated immune response. Therefore, members of this signaling pathway are subject to investigation as intervention points for pharmacological inhibition. Initial investigations targeted IFN-I downstream signaling, including IFN-I proteins, IFNAR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. For example, sifalimumab (anti-IFN-&alpha; mAb), anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR1) and the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, can all potentially tackle the effector function of dysregulated IFN by blocking downstream IFN-I signaling, but do not contribute to reducing the production of IFN. Upstream targeting of TBK1 and/or IKK&epsilon; could be effective at blocking <i>de novo</i> IFN-I induction by a variety of stimuli. Small molecule kinase inhibitors of TBK1/IKK&epsilon; already in development for cancer may expedite investigation for inflammatory diseases also.",

In the human genome, 58 RTKs have been identified, which fall into 20 families. <br><br>All RTKs display an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, a cytoplasmic region containing the protein tyrosine kinase activity (occasionally split into two domains by an insertion, termed the kinase insertion), with juxta-membrane and C-terminal regulatory regions. Agonist binding to the extracellular domain evokes dimerization, and sometimes oligomerization, of RTKs (a small subset of RTKs forms multimers even in the absence of activating ligand). This leads to autophosphorylation in the tyrosine kinase domain in a trans orientation, serving as a site of assembly of protein complexes and stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-&gamma;, mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. <br><br> RTKs are of widespread interest not only through physiological functions, but also as drug targets in many types of cancer and other disease states. Many diseases result from genetic changes or abnormalities that either alter the activity, abundance, cellular distribution and/or regulation of RTKs. Therefore, drugs that modify the dysregulated functions of these RTKs have been developed which fall into two categories. One group is often described as ###?##?biologicals###?##?#, which block the activation of RTKs directly or by chelating the cognate ligands, while the second are small molecules designed to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity directly.",

Intriguingly, the endogenous peptide ligands are formed in a parallel fashion with post-translational processing producing a heterodimer linked by disulphide bridges. Signalling through the receptors is mediated through a rapid autophosphorylation event at intracellular tyrosine residues, followed by recruitment of multiple adaptor proteins, notably <i>IRS1</i> (P35568), <i>IRS2</i> (Q9Y4H2), <i>SHC1</i> (P29353), <i>GRB2</i> (P62993) and <i>SOS1</i> (Q07889).<br><br>Serum levels of free IGFs are kept low by the action of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1-5, P08833, P18065, P17936, P22692, P24593), which sequester the IGFs; overexpression of IGFBPs may induce apoptosis, while IGFBP levels are also altered in some cancers.",

Agonist binding initiates formation of a cell-surface complex of type I and type II RSTK, possibly heterotetrameric, where where both subunits express serine/threonine kinase activity. The type I receptor serine/threonine kinases are also known as activin receptors or activin receptor-like kinases, ALKs, for which a systematic nomenclature has been proposed (ALK1-7). The type II protein phosphorylates the kinase domain of the type I partner (sometimes referred to as the signal propagating subunit), causing displacement of the protein partners, such as the FKBP12 FK506-binding protein <i>FKBP1A</i> (P62942) and allowing the binding and phosphorylation of particular members of the Smad family. These migrate to the nucleus and act as complexes to regulate gene transcription. Type III receptors, sometimes called co-receptors or accessory proteins, regulate the signalling of the receptor complex, in either enhancing (for example, presenting the ligand to the receptor) or inhibitory manners. TGF&beta; family ligand signalling may be inhibited by endogenous proteins, such as follistatin, which binds and neutralizes activins to prevent activation of the target receptors.<br><br>Endogenous agonists, approximately 30 in man, are often described as paracrine messengers acting close to the source of production. They are characterized by six conserved cysteine residues and are divided into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence comparison and signalling pathways activated, the TGF&beta;/activin/nodal subfamily and the BMP/GDF (growth/differentiation factor)/MIS (M&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance) subfamily. Ligands active at RSTKs appear to be generated as large precursors which undergo complex maturation processes. Some are known to form disulphide-linked homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes. Thus, inhibins are &alpha; subunits linked to a variety of &beta; chains, while activins are combinations of &beta; subunits.",

      "description": "Presenilin (PS)-1 or -2 act as the catalytic component/essential co-factor of the &gamma;-secretase complex responsible for the final carboxy-terminal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the generation of amyloid beta (A&beta;). Given that the accumulation and aggregation of A&beta; in the brain is pivotal in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), inhibition of PS activity is one mechanism being investigated as a therapeutic option for AD. Several small molecule inhibitors of PS-1 have been investigated, with some reaching early clinical trials, but none have been formally approved. Dewji <i>et al</i>. (2015) have reported that small peptide fragments of human PS-1 can significantly inhibit A&beta; production (total A&beta;, A&beta;40 and A&beta;42) both <i>in vitro</i> and when infused in to the brains of APP transgenic mice. The most active small peptides in this report were P4 [PMID: 25923432] and P8 [PMID: 25923432], from the amino-terminal domain of PS-1.",

GAD1 is expressed in later life and is more associated with nerve terminals where GABA is principally accumulated in vesicles through the action of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter SLC32A1. The role of &gamma;-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH9A1) in neurotransmitter GABA synthesis is less clear. Following release from neurons, GABA may interact with either GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and may be accumulated in neurones and glia through the action of members of the SLC6 family of transporters. Successive metabolism through GABA transaminase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase generates succinic acid, which may be further metabolized in the mitochondria in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.",

In the somatic nervous system, it activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. It is also employed in the autonomic nervous system, in both parasympathetic and sympathetic branches; in the former, at the smooth muscle neuromuscular junction, activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In the latter, acetylcholine is involved as a neurotransmitter at the ganglion, activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Acetylcholine is synthesised in neurones through the action of choline O-acetyltransferase and metabolised after release through the extracellular action of acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase. Choline is accumulated from the extracellular medium by selective transporters (see SLC5A7 and the SLC44 family). Acetylcholine is accumulated in synaptic vesicles through the action of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter SLC18A3.",

The predominant catacholamines in mammalian biology are the neurotransmitter/hormones dopamine, (-)-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and (-)-adrenaline (epinephrine). These hormone/transmitters are synthesized by sequential metabolism from L-phenylalanine via L-tyrosine. Hydroxylation of L-tyrosine generates levodopa, which is decarboxylated to form dopamine. Hydroxylation of the ethylamine sidechain generates (-)-noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which can be methylated to form (-)-adrenaline (epinephrine). In particular neuronal and adrenal chromaffin cells, the catecholamines dopamine, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline are accumulated into vesicles under the influence of the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT1/SLC18A1 and VMAT2/SLC18A2). After release into the synapse or the bloodstream, catecholamines are accumulated through the action cell-surface transporters, primarily the dopamine (DAT/SLC6A3) and norepinephrine transporter (NET/SLC6A2). The primary routes of metabolism of these catecholamines are oxidation via monoamine oxidase activities of methylation via catechol O-methyltransferase.",

N-Acylation allows the formation of dihydroceramides, which are subsequently reduced to form ceramides. Once synthesized, ceramides are trafficked from the ER to the Golgi bound to the ceramide transfer protein, CERT (<i>COL4A3BP</i>, Q9Y5P4). Ceramide can be metabolized via multiple routes, ensuring tight regulation of its cellular levels. Addition of phosphocholine generates sphingomyelin while carbohydrate is added to form glucosyl- or galactosylceramides. Ceramidase re-forms sphingosine or sphinganine from ceramide or dihydroceramide. Phosphorylation of ceramide generates ceramide phosphate. The determination of accurate kinetic parameters for many of the enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway is complicated by the lipophilic nature of the substrates.",

However, it also has a number of intracellular targets. S1P is formed by the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of sphingosine, catalysed by two isoforms of sphingosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.91). It can be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3) or cleaved into phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (EC 4.1.2.27). Recessive mutations in the S1P lyase (SPL) gene underlie a recently identified sphingolipidosis: SPL Insufficiency Syndrome (SPLIS). In general, S1P promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis. Intracellular S1P affects epigenetic regulation, endosomal processing, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation/senescence. S1P has myriad physiological functions, including vascular development, lymphocyte trafficking and neurogenesis. However, S1P is also involved in a number of diseases such as cancer, inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, its GPCRs and enzymes of synthesis and degradation are a major focus for drug discovery.",

There are splice variants of each isoform (SphK1a-c and SphK2a, b), distinguished by their N-terminal sequences. SPHK1 and SPHK2 differ in tissue distribution, sub-cellular localisation, biochemical properties and regulation. They regulate discrete pools of S1P. Receptor stimulation induces SPHK1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. SPHK1 translocation is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, specific protein:protein interactions and interaction with specific lipids at the plasma membrane. SPHK1 is a dimeric protein, as confirmed by its crystal structure which forms a positive cluster, between protomers, essential for interaction with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. SPHK2 is localised to the ER or associated with mitochondria or shuttles in/out of the nucleus, regulated by phosphorylation. Intracellular targets of nuclear S1P include the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) and regulators of gene expression including histone deacetylases (HDAC 1/2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&gamma;). SPHK2 phosphorylates the pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, which is used to treat some forms of multiple sclerosis) to a mimic of S1P and that acts as a functional antagonist of S1P<sub>1</sub> receptors.

In normal cells, tissues and organs, precise co-ordination of these proteins ensures expression of only those genes required to specify phenotype or which are required at specific times, for specific functions. Chromatin modifications allow DNA modifications not coded by the DNA sequence to be passed on through the genome and underlies heritable phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation, aging, heterochromatin formation, reprogramming, and gene silencing (epigenetic control). <br>To date at least eight distinct types of modifications are found on histones. These include small covalent modifications such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, the attachment of larger modifiers such as ubiquitination or sumoylation, and ADP ribosylation, proline isomerization and deimination. Chromatin modifications and the functions they regulate in cells are reviewed by Kouzarides (2007).<br><br> <b>Writer</b> proteins include the histone methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases, some kinases and ubiquitin ligases.<br><b>Readers</b> include proteins which contain methyl-lysine-recognition motifs such as bromodomains, chromodomains, tudor domains, PHD zinc fingers, PWWP domains and MBT domains.<br><b>Erasers</b> include the histone demethylases and histone deacetylases (HDACs and sirtuins).<br><br>Dysregulated epigenetic control can be associated with human diseases such as cancer , where a wide variety of cellular and protein abberations are known to perturb chromatin structure, gene transcription and ultimately cellular pathways.

Cellular membranes are hydrophobic and, therefore, effective barriers to separate them allowing the formation of gradients, which can be exploited, for example, in the generation of energy. Membrane transporters carry solutes across cell membranes, which would otherwise be impermeable to them. The energy required for active transport processes is obtained from ATP turnover or by exploiting ion gradients. <br><br>ATP-driven transporters can be divided into three major classes: P-type ATPases; F-type or V-type ATPases and ATP-binding cassette transporters. The first of these, P-type ATPases, are multimeric proteins, which transport (primarily) inorganic cations. The second, F-type or V-type ATPases, are proton-coupled motors, which can function either as transporters or as motors. Last, are ATP-binding cassette transporters, heavily involved in drug disposition as well as transporting endogenous solutes.<br><br>The second largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome, after the G protein-coupled receptors, are the SLC solute carrier family. Within the solute carrier family, there are not only a great variety of solutes transported, from simple inorganic ions to amino acids and sugars to relatively complex organic molecules like haem. The solute carrier family includes 52 families of almost 400 members. Many of these overlap in terms of the solutes that they carry. For example, amino acids accumulation is mediated by members of the SLC1, SLC3/7, SLC6, SLC15, SLC16, SLC17, SLC32, SLC36, SLC38 and SLC43 families. Further members of the SLC superfamily regulate ion fluxes at the plasma membrane, or solute transport into and out of cellular organelles. Some SLC family members remain orpahn transporters, in as much as a physiological function has yet to be dtermined. Within the SLC superfamily, there is an abundance in diversity of structure. Two families (SLC3 and SLC7) only generate functional transporters as heteromeric partners, where one partner is a single TM domain protein. Membrane topology predictions for other families suggest 3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 or 14 TM domains. The SLC transporters include members which function as antiports, where solute movement in one direction is balanced by a solute moving in the reverse direction. Symports allow concentration gradients of one solute to allow movement of a second solute across a membrane. A third, relatively small group are equilibrative transporters, which allow solutes to travel across membranes down their concentration gradients. A more complex family of transporters, the SLC27 fatty acid transporters also express enzymatic function. Many of the transporters also express electrogenic properties of ion channels.",

The crystal structure of a glutamate transporter homologue (GltPh) from <i>Pyrococcus horikoshii</i> supports this topology and indicates that the transporter assembles as a trimer, where each monomer is a functional unit capable of substrate permeation reviewed by ). This structural data is in agreement with the proposed quaternary structure for EAAT2 and several functional studies that propose the monomer is the functional unit. Recent evidence suggests that EAAT3 and EAAT4 may assemble as heterotrimers. The activity of glutamate transporters located upon both neurones (predominantly EAAT3, 4 and 5) and glia (predominantly EAAT 1 and 2) serves, dependent upon their location, to regulate excitatory neurotransmission, maintain low ambient extracellular concentrations of glutamate (protecting against excitotoxicity) and provide glutamate for metabolism including the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that maintains the ion gradients that drive transport has been demonstrated to co-assemble with EAAT1 and EAAT2. Recent evidence supports altered glutamate transport and novel roles in brain for splice variants of EAAT1 and EAAT2. Three patients with dicarboxylic aminoaciduria (DA) were recently found to have loss-of-function mutations in EAAT3. DA is characterized by excessive excretion of the acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate and EAAT3 is the predominant glutamate/aspartate transporter in the kidney. Enhanced expression of EAAT2 resulting from administration of &beta;-lactam antibiotics (<i>e.g.</i> ceftriaxone) is neuroprotective and occurs through NF-&kappa;B-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation reviewed by ). PPAR&gamma; activation (<i>e.g</i>. by rosiglitazone) also leads to enhanced expression of EAAT though promoter activation. In addition, several translational activators of EAAT2 have recently been described along with treatments that increase the surface expression of EAAT2 (<i>e.g.</i> ), or prevent its down-regulation (<i>e.g.</i> ). A thermodynamically uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> flux, activated by Na<sup>+</sup> and glutamate (Na<sup>+</sup> and aspartate in the case of GltPh ), is sufficiently large, in the instances of EAAT4 and EAAT5, to influence neuronal excitability. Indeed, it has recently been suggested that the primary function of EAAT5 is as a slow anion channel gated by glutamate, rather than a glutamate transporter.",

      "description": "The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is an iodide transporter found principally in the thyroid gland where it mediates the accumulation of I<sup>-</sup> within thyrocytes. Transport of I<sup>-</sup> by NIS from the blood across the basolateral membrane followed by apical efflux into the colloidal lumen, mediated at least in part by pendrin (SLC22A4), and most likely not SMCT1 (SLC5A8) as once thought, provides the I<sup>-</sup> required for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine. NIS is also expressed in the salivary glands, gastric mucosa, intestinal enterocytes and lactating breast. NIS mediates I<sup>-</sup> absorption in the intestine and I<sup>-</sup> secretion into the milk. SMVT is expressed on the apical membrane of intestinal enterocytes and colonocytes and is the main system responsible for biotin (vitamin H) and pantothenic acid (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>) uptake in humans. SMVT located in kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells mediates the reabsorption of biotin and pantothenic acid. SMCT1 (SLC5A8), which transports a wide range of monocarboxylates, is expressed in the apical membrane of epithelia of the small intestine, colon, kidney, brain neurones and the retinal pigment epithelium. SMCT2 (SLC5A12) also localises to the apical membrane of kidney, intestine, and colon, but in the brain and retina is restricted to astrocytes and M#?##ller cells, respectively. SMCT1 is a high-affinity transporter whereas SMCT2 is a low-affinity transporter. The physiological substrates for SMCT1 and SMCT2 are lactate (L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid), pyruvic acid, propanoic acid, and nicotinic acid in non-colonic tissues such as the kidney. SMCT1 is also likely to be the principal transporter for the absorption of nicotinic acid (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in the intestine and kidney. In the small intestine and colon, the physiological substrates for these transporters are nicotinic acid and the short-chain fatty acids acetic acid, propanoic acid, and butyric acid that are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber. In the kidney, SMCT2 is responsible for the bulk absorption of lactate because of its low-affinity/high-capacity nature. Absence of both transporters in the kidney leads to massive excretion of lactate in urine and consequently drastic decrease in the circulating levels of lactate in blood. SMCT1 also functions as a tumour suppressor in the colon as well as in various other non-colonic tissues. The tumour-suppressive function of SMCT1 is based on its ability to transport pyruvic acid, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, into cells in non-colonic tissues ; in the colon, the ability of SMCT1 to transport butyric acid and propanoic acid, also inhibitors of histone deacetylases, underlies the tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. The ability of SMCT1 to promote histone acetylase inhibition through accumulation of butyric acid and propanoic acid in immune cells is also responsible for suppression of dendritic cell development in the colon.",

Nonetheless, ambient concentrations of GABA are sufficient to sustain tonic inhibition mediated by high affinity GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in certain neuronal populations. GAT1 is the predominant GABA transporter in the brain and occurs primarily upon the terminals of presynaptic neurones and to a much lesser extent upon distal astocytic processes that are in proximity to axons terminals. GAT3 resides predominantly on distal astrocytic terminals that are close to the GABAergic synapse. By contrast, BGT1 occupies an extrasynaptic location possibly along with GAT2 which has limited expression in the brain. TauT is a high affinity taurine transporter involved in osmotic balance that occurs in the brain and non-neuronal tissues, such as the kidney, brush border membrane of the intestine and blood brain barrier. CT1, which transports creatine, has a ubiquitous expression pattern, often co-localizing with creatine kinase.",

Five variants of GlyT1 (a,b,c,d & e) differing in their N- and C-termini are generated by alternative promoter usage and splicing, and three splice variants of GlyT2 (a,b & c) have also been identified (see for reviews). GlyT1 transporter isoforms expressed in glia surrounding glutamatergic synapses regulate synaptic glycine concentrations influencing NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission , but also are important, in early neonatal life, for regulating glycine concentrations at inhibitory glycinergic synapses. Homozygous mice engineered to totally lack GlyT1 exhibit severe respiratory and motor deficiencies due to hyperactive glycinergic signalling and die within the first postnatal day. Disruption of GlyT1 restricted to forebrain neurones is associated with enhancement of EPSCs mediated by NMDA receptors and behaviours that are suggestive of a promnesic action. GlyT2 transporters localised on the axons and boutons of glycinergic neurones appear crucial for efficient transmitter loading of synaptic vesicles but may not be essential for the termination of inhibitory neurotransmission. Mice in which GlyT2 has been deleted develop a fatal hyperekplexia phenotype during the second postnatal week and mutations in the human gene encoding GlyT2 (SLC6A5) have been identified in patients with hyperekplexia (reviewed by ). ATB<sup>0+</sup> (SLC6A14) is a transporter for numerous dipolar and cationic amino acids and thus has a much broader substrate specificity than the glycine transporters alongside which it is grouped on the basis of structural similarity. ATB<sup>0+</sup> is expressed in various peripheral tissues.

Topographical modelling suggests that the majority of the variants of SLC14 transporters have 10 TM domains, with a glycosylated extracellular loop at TM5/6, and intracellular C- and N-termini.

      "description": "The SLC51 organic solute transporter family of transporters is a pair of heterodimeric proteins which regulate bile salt movements in the small intestine, bile duct, and liver, as part of the enterohepatic circulation. OST&alpha;/OST&beta; is also expressed in steroidogenic cells of the brain and adrenal gland, where it may contribute to steroid movement. Bile acid transport is suggested to be facilitative and independent of sodium, potassium, chloride ions or protons. OST&alpha;/OST&beta; heterodimers have been shown to transport [<sup>3</sup>H]taurocholic acid, [<sup>3</sup>H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, [<sup>3</sup>H]estrone-3-sulphate, [<sup>3</sup>H]pregnenolone sulphate and [<sup>3</sup>H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. OST&alpha;/OST&beta;-mediated transport of bile salts is inhibited by clofazimine. OST&alpha; is suggested to be a seven TM protein, while OST&beta; is a single TM 'ancillary' protein, both of which are thought to have intracellular C-termini. Both proteins function in solute transport and bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies suggest the possibility of OST&alpha; homo-oligomers, as well as OST&alpha;/OST&beta; hetero-oligomers. An inherited mutation in OST&beta; is associated with congenital diarrhea in children.",

The family is structurally subdivided into three distinct groups based on the presence of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1-4).<br><br>1: Proapoptotic BH3-only subgroup; Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, Hrk, Bmf, Noxa, Puma and bNIP3<br>2: Proapoptotic 'effectors'; Bak, Bok and Bax<br>3: Antiapoptotic subgroup; Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and Bcl2-A1.<br><br>Binding between pro- and anti-apoptotic members <i>via</i> BH domains dictates the death or survival of cells. The BH3-only subgroup members initiate apoptosis in response to cellular damage. In response to these same signals the proapoptotic subgroup containing BH1-3 (Bax and Bak) oligomerize on the mitochondrial membrane, acting to increase mitochondrial membrane permeability to apoptogenic factors (such as cytochrome C) stored in the mitochondrial lumen. When released, these factors activate cell-killing caspases. The antiapoptotic members contain all four BH domains and protect cells from apoptosis by directly binding to and sequestering their proapoptotic counterparts <i>via</i> BH3 interactions.<br><br>Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is associated with various cancers in which the normal apoptotic pathway is inhibited, leading to abnormal and dysregulated cell proliferation. Prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins are therefore tractable drug targets for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies, as well as immunotherapies. Small molecule antagonists of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins would be expected to restore normal apoptotic signaling in tumor cells by up-regulating proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein activity. These compounds may also be able to combat the resistance to chemotherapy which often develops in Bcl-2-overexpressing cancers.<br><br><i><b>Synonyms and (human gene symbols)</b></i>;<br>Bcl-2 (BCL2), Bcl-xL (BCL2L1), Bcl-w (BCL2L2), Mcl-1 (MCL1), Bcl2-A1 (BCL2A1), Bax (BAX), Bok (BOK), Bak (BAK1), Bad (BAD), Bid (BID), Bim (BCL2L11), Bmf (BMF), Bik (BIK), Hrk (HRK), Noxa (PMAIP1), Puma (BBC3), bNIP3 (BNIP3).",

      "description": "Transthyretin (TTR) is a homo-tetrameric protein which transports thyroxine in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma. Many disease causing mutations in the protein have been reported, many of which cause complex dissociation and protein mis-assembly and deposition of toxic aggregates amyloid fibril formation. These amyloidogenic mutants are linked to the development of pathological amyloidoses, including familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) , familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) , amyloidotic vitreous opacities, carpal tunnel syndrome and others. In old age, non-mutated TTR can also form pathological amyloid fibrils. Pharmacological intervention to reduce or prevent TTR dissociation is being pursued as a theapeutic strategy. To date one small molecule kinetic stabilising molecule has been approved for FAP, and is being evaluated in clinical trials for other TTR amyloidoses.",

Each member of this highly conserved receptor family plays a unique role in cell-fate determination during embryogenesis, differentiation, tissue patterning, proliferation and cell death. As the Notch ligands are also membrane bound, cells have to be in close proximity for receptor-ligand interactions to occur. Cleavage of the intracellular domain (ICD) of activated Notch receptors by &gamma;-secretase is required for downstream signalling and Notch-induced transcriptional modulation. This is why &gamma;-secretase inhibitors can be used to downregulate Notch signalling and explains their anti-cancer action. One such small molecule is RO4929097 , although development of this compound has been terminated following an unsuccessful Phase II single agent clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer.<br><br>Aberrant Notch signalling is implicated in a number of human cancers , with demcizumab and tarextumab identified as antibody inhibitors of ligand:receptor binding.",
