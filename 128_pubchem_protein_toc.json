      "description": "The Target Development Level (TDL) is computed based on the degree to which the targets are studied, as evidenced by publications, tool compounds, and other features. TDL is one of four potential values: Tclin, Tchem, Tbio or Tdark. Tclin are protein drug targets via which approved drugs act; Tchem are proteins that are not Tclin, but are known to bind small molecules with high potency; Tbio includes proteins that have Gene Ontology 'leaf' (lowest level) term annotations based on experimental evidence, or meet two of the following three conditions: A fractional publication count above 5, three or more Gene RIF annotations, or 50 or more commercial antibodies; Tdark includes human proteins that were manually curated at the primary sequence level in UniProt, but do not meet any of the Tclin, Tchem or Tbio criteria.",
